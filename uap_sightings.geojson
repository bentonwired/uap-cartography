The sphere exhibits a clear band around it, leading to confirmations of previous sightings.\n3. The phenomenon suggests that these spheres can levitate, with many sightings occurring near power lines and populated areas.\n4. Recent recordings show similar spheres globally, indicating an increasing frequency of their appearances.\n5. Evidence from various locations includes metallic spheres levitating and moving close to electrical cables, raising questions about their nature and intentions.\n6. Sightings from cities like San Diego and Manchester detail spheres captured near urban infrastructures.\n7. The growing number of sightings implies a coordinated phenomenon, prompting speculation about the motives of whoever or whatever controls these objects.\n8.

Every clear night, usually around 8 or 9 pm. I live in CT and started watching the night sky almost every night for a little bit around this time ever since the whole drone thing. I started this back in November, and like I already said I only started seeing these orbs in February. So it was highly unusual to me.\n\nI have the FlightRadar app and can see all the planes, helicopters, etc. and know what those lights look like. Some military craft like Chinooks, Globemasters, Blackhawks show up on the app, but I have seen some F22 Raptors during the day that don't show up on the app so I know some unregistered craft will not show up. So I am wondering if these things I'm seeing are UFO or just secret military craft?\n\nI also thought of satellites, but whenever I searched that up it says there are no satellites visible from my area and times where one may be visible are few and far between. And from what I've seen online this behavior does not match. I have seen literally 20+ of them in the span of 30 minutes some nights, no way they are satellites?\n\nMore details: these orbs vary in dimness/brightness, but all seem to go about the same speed. They come and go from various directions across the sky and usually disappear over the horizon, but I have seen a few fade out! Also I noticed a trend where the majority of them will come from the treeline in the West of my yard.\n\nI don't have a good camera, these videos were taken on an iPhone 13, otherwise I would have taken more videos but the dim ones barely show up. I can see them much better with my naked eye.\n\nThe first video (first minute 23 secs) shows one of the brightest ones I have ever seen (compare it to the stars, it's much brighter!) and then another one I saw right after that was about the same brightness as the stars.\n\nThe second video shows two travelling almost parallel to each other, and then I saw two more that were quite dim and you can barely make them out in the video.\n\nPlease help me figure out what these are!

It may interact with objects and is sometimes seen emerging from lakes or enclosed spaces.\n\n**Page 2-4: LIGHT CHARACTERISTICS**\n\nMost sightings fall into specific color categories:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Blue, red, violet, yellow, and variations of these colors.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Sometimes surrounded by bluish envelopes, [emitting sparks or fireworks-like trails](https://youtu.be/fpIdQ7k_w9Y?si=Kgh96CAaF6ItIdKT) , and exhibiting glowing tentacles.\n\nBall lightning may leave smoky trails or [emit bright flashes](https://youtu.be/LYSuZeWzmPI?si=VtnzCGcEnpOsI_B9) , sometimes pulsating with color or [creating misty appearances](https://youtu.be/IBL3v-T5MSo?si=8PrsfLmc1LPwzfPM) \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThere are multiple other research papers presenting similar video evidence like the [Extraterrestrial Life in the Thermosphere: Plasmas, UAP, Pre-Life, Fourth State of Matter](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=131506#return211) that studied the [NASA STS missions](https://youtu.be/rYtn6lgdXhg?si=libnbkz5gKH_AvD6) - quoting the different astronaut sightings, and measuring the trajectory of what is on video showing their nonlinear flight path, consuming one another and changing speed. ***Its undeniable***\nAlso the recent [Tedesco Brothers](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=135539) who also have compelling video evidence and data supporting their findings, here\u2019s a [Interview](https://youtu.be/yjQX4XPw7Bg?si=cxsaJIyByq75zo_g)\n\nThere are also several YouTube channels that have been filming the same types of anomalies that Jake Barber and the Skywatcher team have recently been showcasing\u2014anomalies that match the characteristics and features described in numerous research papers on atmospheric coherent plasma. The key difference is that these videos are extremely high quality, with thousands of recordings available.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice strong similarities to the black-and-white thermal footage released by the DoD and other government agencies. However, the major distinction is that these civilian-captured videos are in color\u2014which is a significant detail. When we examine UFO footage taken by civilians, we often see vibrant colors and behaviors that don\u2019t align with traditional aircraft\u2014exactly what these channels are showing, including footage of [smaller objects emerging from larger ones](https://youtu.be/0nDAO_olxGM?si=czfBhowHLH7wHUeI)\n\nI want to add before anyone calls bullcrap (because they see a number). The researcher explains exactly why that is [Which he explains and demonstrates here](https://youtu.be/QeAbuBsYP5c?si=xV1n8oYTJtR0FAmq) and it\u2019s because he writes it on the ground with big Plywood boards** - ***You are seeing mimickry*** This is not a new feature\u2014many researchers and whistleblowers have noted that this phenomenon can mimic or imitate elements in its environment.\n\nHere are some channels:\n\n [Plasmoid Anomalies Study Group](https://youtube.com/@miamiufo?si=jrOlLmEqTEywsp1u)\n\n[Mr Anonymous](https://youtube.com/@skywatcheranomalous89?si=Cpr7bGT7eSymBfdf)\n\n[Jay C Aerial Anomalies](https://youtube.com/@ufojonathancastro?si=ImVcCZo__LS2YQo3)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting this phenomenon has been studied since the 1950s by **Trevor James Constable*** (1925\u20132016), a **radio officer in the U.S. Merchant Marine** during and after World War II which gave him a strong background in **electronics, radio waves, and atmospheric conditions**. He was one of the first to detect these anomalies during the war. After his service, he dedicated his life to this field. I highly recommend his books:\n\n***They Live in the Sky!*** (1958)\n\n***The Cosmic Pulse of Life*** (1976)\n\n***Sky Creatures: Living UFOs*** (1978)\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThere\u2019s much more to cover, including topics like consciousness, ESP (which, if you recall, **Ben Rich**, former director of Lockheed Martin\u2019s Skunk Works said **\u201cit\u2019s all about ESP\u201d**), and the reported telepathic connections between experiencers and non-human intelligences. I\u2019d also love to touch on free energy\u2014but I\u2019ll leave it there for now!\n\nSome closing thoughts,  It\u2019s very telling how deeply manipulation and programmed cognitive dissonance have been successfully implemented in the public at large. Critical thinking and independent research are almost frowned upon. Most people won\u2019t even entertain an idea they instinctively disagree with\u2014essentially boxing themselves in from ever gaining a different perspective. Unless the talking heads bring it up and hold their hand saying, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to think this now,\u201d they won\u2019t budge. It\u2019s sad, really.\n\nI say this because I\u2019ve brought this information in front of this sub before and was immediately met with pushback. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of verifiable evidence I share\u2014the reaction is almost always the same.\n\nI\u2019m hoping that with this new whistleblower confirming the Immaculate Constellation document, more of you will take a second look at the corroborating evidence across other sources and cases, and begin to form a fuller picture.\n\nAs I stated at the start: the evidence is all there.

Duration: 30 minutes. Number of witnesses: two people, two cameras. Description of sighting: I filmed anomalous orbs in four clips in one night with my Sony RX10 Mk. IV and a Wyze Cam V4\n\nThis is a compilation of my best footage since I gained renewed interest in skywatching last fall. The footage features anomalous objects filmed at dusk, night and dawn around the Oregon Country Fairgrounds and surrounding areas. Anything I choose to upload has been cross-checked via three or more of the listed databases in the acknowledgments, to rule out the vast majority of human activity. All footage is from one of three locations- a lot just south of hwy 126, west of Countryside Pizza,  my street, just north of the Oregon Country Fair, and once from a car driving south on territorial, towards Countryside Pizza.\n\nThese objects exhibit change in heading and velocity, all the way from outclassing other aircraft to stopping midair. They do not behave like any publicly-known satellite or aircraft. They cross paths with one or more other (usually smaller) objects flying intersecting, tightly overlapping routes. Modern propulsion systems cannot explain their behavior.\n\nThey carry no legally required lighting and run no types of transponder, exemptions for which are exceedingly rare. Using just my footage, an extremely frequent repeat route can be established- on most nights, into morning, at least one object will slowly pass west-to-east over the fairgrounds, usually several. \n\nThese objects vary greatly in color, size, behavior, and grouping, often traveling in perfectly interlocked pairs and triangle formations, moving in unison. \n\nThis compilation icludes footage recorded on a Sony RX10 Mk.IV  camera (4K video), a Fimi Mini 3 Drone (4k Video), A Sony IMX678 Starvis2 box camera with a 5-50 mm cs mount varifocal lens (4k video), A full-color & infrared night vision camera with a Sony \"starlight\" sensor and 15x zoom (4k Video), a Google Pixel 7 (4k video), a Wyze Cam V4 (2.5k video), and a Rettru Q8S Starlight color night vision security camera (1080p video). \nEnjoy, much more to come", "report_date": "2025-04-14T01:47:51+00:00", "sighting_id": 48, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": null, "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "duration_seconds": null, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "727", "weather_conditions": null}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.43428, 37.5385087]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1kg9hot/glowing_orange_orb/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 37.5385087, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -77.43428, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/pmhs75rvy6ze1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-02-13T00:30:00+00:00", "description": "Glowing Orange Orb\nI was looking over the James River when I saw a solid, orange orb hovering over Manchester.

They pretended to be starts and had bouncy bug like movement like last time. A couple blinked sparkles like the one in the video. You can\u2019t see it well in the video but with the naked eye that one was sparkly. The videos pretty irrelevant, I don\u2019t care to hear complaints about the quality of it.\n\nThey formed triangles all over the sky around us. A triangle formed closely above us and slowly lowered closer. I got strange sensations watching it and had a surge of adrenaline. It was absolutely mesmerizing and captivating. Ajay and I both felt extremely calm and relaxed. We were in a trance like state. They were only like 25ft above us. I instinctively did deep intense breathing as the mesmerizing triangle got closer, they put me in an altered state I haven\u2019t experienced before. Felt like being hypnotized. They had a strong presence. I\u2019m not even sure how to describe the feelings I had but it was very nice. It felt like time slowed down. Ajay grabbed his phone to take a video and they stopped moving. It was like we both had to be focused on them, and I think they didn\u2019t want to be photographed. He couldn\u2019t capture them on his video and for the next 2 hours they stayed in that same spot above us. \n\nWe watched from 10:30-12:15 but we both swore it had only been 30-45 minutes. Time was passing extremely fast, we both agreed it felt about 3 times too fast. That probably had to do with our trance state. We\u2019ve been having trouble getting along for a while and this experience really healed our friendship (at least for now lol). The longer we watched together the closer I felt to my roommate. At the start I was trying not to get annoyed by him and by the end my resentment towards him was gone and replaced by lots of love and connection. I felt cuddly and affectionate from watching them, I really wanted a hug from the orbs.\n\nAt one point Ajay went inside for a few minutes and I was excited to have private experiences with the orbs but I didn\u2019t see any till he returned. I felt so calm and happy and grateful watching them, strangely those feelings weakened when my roommate wasn\u2019t with me. I had felt like the orbs were for me since I\u2019m a regular experiencer. I got over this selfish feeling and realized they were for both of us and our shared experience. Right after Ajay came back outside I told him how they went away when he left and that the energy weren\u2019t as good alone and in that second Ajay saw what looked like an orange shooting star quickly dart close to us. It happened in half a second and I didn\u2019t see it. I believe it was responding to my words. He said it looked like something out of Star Wars. \n\nAjay has better eyesight than me and saw faint blue lines connecting a triangle of orbs. He also saw a single moving orb disappear into a magnetic field or something. He said it looked like the ufo entered a strange cloud. We saw a few duplicate and shape-shift. Some just looked like lights and others looked like crafts. A couple rotated while moving. We both felt so calm and peaceful during and after watching them. It was such intense calm that I\u2019m not used to. \n\nThey\u2019re out basically all night every night.

The object appeared to be stationary or drifting extremely slowly, but held its general position for 30 to 60 minutes. I went inside the house and came back out multiple times during this period, and each time it remained in place.\n\nKey characteristics:\n\t\u2022\tBright, solid white outer rim\n\t\u2022\tTranslucent, lighter interior center, almost shimmering or glowing faintly\n\t\u2022\tNo visible wings, propellers, or tether\n\t\u2022\tNo sound or visible motion\n\t\u2022\tIt appeared to be hovering or suspended, not drifting freely like a balloon would\n\nIt did not resemble any kind of aircraft, drone, balloon, or bird I\u2019ve ever seen.

Open to ideas.\nTime: 8:05pm\n\nLocation: Henderson Nevada \n\nI don\u2019t like to jump to conclusions so I will keep it short and not add my speculation opting instead for just the facts of what I witnessed. I was on an evening walk with my mother when we both stopped talking and looked at a strange color changing orb in the sky. We both started to record and I managed to get the ball of light moving across the sky but just as I stopped recording and it started to vanish right in font of our eyes. \n\nAt the time I was not aware that my mom was still recording and she captured the object phasing out of visibility. In person in looked as if it cloaked but I don\u2019t want to speculate so it vanished is the simplest way I could put it. There was no sound and visible tail like a comet or shooting star. It was shifting colors and there was no haze or light scatter. It was moving steady but not super fast. \n\nThe videos do this no justice at all. It was so bright and vivid and moved as if there was no friction. I then recorded the airplanes flying around just to show how different the light from aircraft look as opposed to this object on camera let alone in person. I can post those for comparison if anyone wants to compare just let me know. All in all I\u2019m not sure what it is but neither of us can figure it out. You can see the aircraft and they are daily identifiable in the area we walk in so this stood out and was nothing like the rest of what we saw. If anyone has ideas or speculation don\u2019t hesitate chime in. \n\nBoth cameras capture a slightly different aspect as they zoom to different. The iPhone was able to get close but it still not close enough so it looked like a flashing dot.

The experience I am having is that these are healing light packets that are being sent down from UFOs. I sense at least a correlation between the appearance of these light packets and UFO appearances. The UFO associated is the one mainstream media calls \"5g SaTelLitEs\". This video is more evidence against the 5g SatelliTe HypotHeSis.\n\nThe experience I am having is that UFOs arrive, then maybe thirty minutes later these light packets fall out of the sky, then shortly after I perceive the ground as if subtly glowing and I have a warm healing feeling in my body. This has been happening very frequently since February. I have had old injuries healing, for example a should injury from 2007, seamingly healed. I believe these light packets are somehow involved. I am able to better receive these light packets by doing lotus pose or sun salutations, which stimulate the pineal gland, increasing reception. I believe something more complex is going on here, beyond the scope of this post.\n\nI'm aware this might sound \"crazy\", and is my subjective experience, but this is simply my honest narrative to accompany the video.\n\nThe sky has been swarming with UFOs in Castell del Rey since February, almost every night.

It looked like some sort of droid drone thing, white, oblong head, a robotic looking body hanging below it, seemingly cut off at the knee caps. It was hovering in a single direction, South west as I perceived it. There wasn\u2019t any nose, not really. Maybe some whirring, but I can\u2019t recall in full. Anyway, at the time, I\u2019d been following the drone situation closely. Wasn\u2019t terribly into the whole NHI deal. Didn\u2019t have any reason to believe in anything like that beyond probability, but believing it exists is different from believing it has any consequence on my own existence. I saw this thing, I thought I must be hallucinating. I looked away and did a double take. When I looked back, I saw a white pelican in its place, flying the same direction. I thought I must be really losing it, though I\u2019d no history of hallucinations.  \n\nAbout a month later, I saw a Reddit post in r/clearwater showing the attached video asking what it was.

I even looked up a lot about 747 flood lights and landing lights\u2026 etc.  The other blinking light turned red from white.  There are more steady lights that don\u2019t blink, and other weird stuff in the sky later in the video (which I can also upload).  We even caught the ISS, or a satellite on camera later, and it looked nothing like these lights.  But this was weird.  I see planes flying in to Sky Harbor Airport all the time, and they don\u2019t look like this.  Helicopters are all over the place here too, and also don\u2019t look like that.

That spends a lot of time stood outside on my own looking up at the sky. I'm familiar with what's up there, I can point out Venus, mars, Saturn etc, and I can follow Orion and other stars across the sky as time passes.  I'm familiar with a flight path that comes across the sky in the opposite direction southeast to northwest from the near by airport in Luton, you can see the aircraft at different altitudes with blinking lights. I've watched satellite cross the sky for over 10 years, way before starlink, and so I'm very familiar with what a satellite is, you can even see the point at which one disappears in the sky  once it's beyond the horizon of the sun light. Because it's the sun's reflection off of the satellite in orbit, not a light. It is none of these things. \n\nI know it's only a blurry light in the sky again, but I have a pixel 9 pro one of the best phones in the market., it's about as good as we are going to get at night in low light. But say, this is my third experience now, I'm actively going to be more prepared and have my phone ready to go.

On Tuesday, April 29th at 20:37, what I\u2019ve been waiting for over many years happened.\nAround 30 objects flew towards Oslo.

Unfortunately, the camera doesn\u2019t capture how clearly visible they were to the naked eye, and in the footage it looks like they\u2019re much farther away.\n\nThey were all within our atmosphere, and we saw them crystal clear.\n\nCheck the video!

On this occasion I had a golden orb streak across the sky, heading from the north west to the south east well below the clouds, but above the tree tops and disappear in the sky, but not from out of sight more like it made itself, not want to be visible to me.\n\nI have had sightings of these orbs many many times, if you were to search my history on this page, I\u2019ve had quite lengthy posts with plenty of documentaries of these objects rather long winded descriptions with many supporting videos.\n\nHaving had this happen before I have noticed the pattern of these orbs, seeming to go into the woods across the street from my house. Sometimes they remain visible to the naked eye. Sometimes they do not sometimes they are visible under IR sometimes they are not. In the event they are not visible by IR. I purchased myself an RSX thermal monocular, that is what this footage is recorded with.  \nI believe I\u2019m witnessing is this orb seems to have landed on top of a tree structure, but not on a large branch, I have footage of owls in the woods raccoons on trees. They are always on a sturdy piece of wood this one is not. What I believe we are witnessing in this video is one of these plasma orb creatures somehow splitting another orb off of itself.  That\u2019s the large ejection effect, if you slow down the speed I believe you can also see smaller orbs eject upwards.\n\nI am going to also post some supporting videos in the comments with a brief description.

I had a 14 hour film shoot the day before so I was surprised my body woke me up so early given how exhausted I was.

The second I\u2019m done throwing up I look up into the sky to catch my breathe and there was a red orb doing all sorts of absolutely mind bending maneuvers. It was whizzing around the sky in a sort of zig zag diagonal pattern. It was so hard to not notice that I started to wipe my eyes due to me thinking clearly they must have been watering having just thrown up, but no, dry as a bone. I don\u2019t suffer from astigmatism and have 20/20 vision, this thing was clear as day. \n\nAfter standing there dumbstruck I pull out my phone to record it.

My initial thoughts were a plane way off the usual flight path however as we got closer what I first thought was a plane to my surprise was almost identical to the size and structure of a Blackhawk style helicopter therefore really catching my attention as I thought someone was about to have swat team sliding down ropes onto their roof. The reason to thinking this was a plane was due to the white, red and slight green/aqua lights however rather then moving like a plane it appeared to be hovering left and right similar to that of a helicopter. As we got closer and closer to the lights it was soon clear that this wasn\u2019t a plane nor a helicopter. The best way to describe what we seen was a drone the size of a helicopter. In the whole excitement and surprise of the moment I took out my phone to record a video of what we were seeing, at this same moment I begun recording the lights slowly disappeared underneath the rooflines of the houses to the right of us. (Video attached) Right after the video clip ended we turned down the street to where this thing had looked to have landed however after spending 45 minutes circling every street within a 3km radius however this thing had just disappeared into the night leaving us confused with no answers but a small video clip to try and convince anyone that I wasn\u2019t going crazy.

I\u2019m a software engineer and developed a AI-based sky detection camera. I posted about it in here awhile ago. I often capture anomalies, but most are minor, like a faint flash or a stationary blinking object, and could easily be explained. This one is different though. \n\nI reviewed the footage and noticed that had flagged four meteorites within roughly 1.5 seconds, an extremely rare detection, and is bucketed as an anomaly. \n\nInterestingly, I later found a post on Reddit (r/BucksCountyPa) and a post in (r/Portlandme) that both are from the same date and time. The Maine post is relevant because the camera faces 68\u00b0 east and the slight left turn the object makes puts the trajectory roughly towards the New England states. The poster who in PA stated:\n\n\u201cI looked up and there was this sporadic, flashing light, quickly moving left to right, fast, then gone, in a space that didn\u2019t have cloud cover.\u201d\n\nThe poster in the r/Portlandme group wasn\u2019t too descriptive but comments in the thread stated it looked like a comet but \u201ccomets don\u2019t disappear\u201d, and these descriptions appear to match. \n\nAlthough I can\u2019t confirm if these sightings were related, the timing and descriptions of both posts are remarkably similar to mine. For how fast the object is moving, it\u2019s not far fetched in my opinion that these sightings could be related. \n\nThe object itself is weird, each flash points towards the next.

Then more orbs were moving slowly around the bright area. \n\nOk so in this video just as I saw the orb you see first, it was slowly moving across the sky, but as soon as I started recording it sped up and zoomed across the sky and hovered above the trees where I could still see it. It looks faster than it was because I literally had to turn myself 180 degrees just so I didn\u2019t lose it in the sky. As it\u2019s hovering, a second one comes out from behind the trees and seems like it goes right through the first one\u2026\n\nI could only film one so I stayed with the second one because it was moving. The first one just hovered where it stopped and they met up, and when I looked back after I lost the other one behind my house, it was gone.\n\nI know I know\u2026 TLDR!
