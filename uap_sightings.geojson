The phenomenon suggests that these spheres can levitate, with many sightings occurring near power lines and populated areas.\n4. Recent recordings show similar spheres globally, indicating an increasing frequency of their appearances.\n5. Evidence from various locations includes metallic spheres levitating and moving close to electrical cables, raising questions about their nature and intentions.\n6. Sightings from cities like San Diego and Manchester detail spheres captured near urban infrastructures.\n7.

(It almost looked like there was a dim but very large beam of light across the sky. I am not sure if this has any relation to what I witnessed, or not, but this is what initially drew my attention to the sky.) \n\nI took my phone out to take a quick picture to see if I could capture the peculiar sky on my phone camera. As I took my picture, a small but very bright ball of green light flew across my phone screen. \n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t really believe what I saw, I figured it was some sort of light glare or camera glitch. When I took my focus off the screen and looked at the sky with my bare eyes, I actually saw the green ball of light, flying erratically all over the sky, making unbelievably sharp angled maneuvers at incredibly fast speeds. \n\nI stood in my driveway in shock and watched this green light for about  5 seconds as I fumbled with my phone to change it to the video setting. As I clicked record, I captured the very end of the green light before it shot up into the sky and out of sight. \n\nI stood outside for the next 30 mins after that, taping the sky and did not see this green ball of light again. \n\nI\u2019ve slowed down and zoomed in the video to get a better look at this light and I have no explanation. The people who I have showed are also without answer. \n\nThis all happened fast! It was silent with the naked ear and standing outside but then I noticed if you watch the slow motion video with headphones on and volume up, you can hear the propulsion of the green ball of light as it passes through the clouds. \n\nI am a photographer and do photograph and look into the sky pretty often but I am not particularly into UFO\u2019s. This was by far the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen in my life. I joined this group only because of this sighting.\n\n\n\nWhen I was younger I would frequently stay out all night taking hundreds of long exposure shots of the night sky and I have never seen anything like this before. I\u2019ve seen my fair share of shooting stars and meteors but this was much different. What I find to be the craziest thing about this is that I only took ONE photo and I happened to randomly catch this green light. The timing was perfect down to the mila second. When I clicked the shutter button on my phone, I saw the green light on the right side of my screen, when you look at the photo the green light was captured on the very left hand side of the screen. That\u2019s how fast this light was moving across the sky. \n\nA couple of things to note : \n-This seemed like it was much lower altitude in the sky than even the clouds. \n- I am 100% convinced this was not a drone or laser. \n- I did not post this sooner for a few reasons but mainly because it was right before all of the NJ drone hysteria and reporting. \n- Lastly, I was not scared / feeling threatened by any means and I was not sad by this sighting but for some reason it had my eyes watering to the point of tears. When I went inside to tell my wife what I saw and every time after that that I have tried to talk about it, my eyes water to the point of tears\u2026. I do not know what this is about and I am not an emotional person, I chalk it up to being in shock I suppose or it\u2019s just that my brain has opened up to a world that I didn\u2019t ever believe existed.

Trying to make sense of it.\nTime: December 22nd between 1-3 PM, dont remember the exact time. \n\nLocation: Tampa, Florida\n\nHey folks, so back on December 22nd, 2024 in Tampa, Florida, I saw this thing floating over the lake in my backyard. It looked like some sort of droid drone thing, white, oblong head, a robotic looking body hanging below it, seemingly cut off at the knee caps. It was hovering in a single direction, South west as I perceived it. There wasn\u2019t any nose, not really. Maybe some whirring, but I can\u2019t recall in full. Anyway, at the time, I\u2019d been following the drone situation closely. Wasn\u2019t terribly into the whole NHI deal. Didn\u2019t have any reason to believe in anything like that beyond probability, but believing it exists is different from believing it has any consequence on my own existence. I saw this thing, I thought I must be hallucinating. I looked away and did a double take. When I looked back, I saw a white pelican in its place, flying the same direction. I thought I must be really losing it, though I\u2019d no history of hallucinations.  \n\nAbout a month later, I saw a Reddit post in r/clearwater showing the attached video asking what it was. It was EXACTLY what I had seen. I took screenshots of the video and tried reverse image searching, nothing. I tried finding the Reddit post again to talk to OP, no longer exists, or at least, isn\u2019t in my saved any longer. Luckily I\u2019d screen recorded the video. Looking to get some insight from others in the community. If nothing else, looking to share. I understand that I can\u2019t prove anything, and I\u2019m fine with that.

They pretended to be starts and had bouncy bug like movement like last time. A couple blinked sparkles like the one in the video. You can\u2019t see it well in the video but with the naked eye that one was sparkly. The videos pretty irrelevant, I don\u2019t care to hear complaints about the quality of it.\n\nThey formed triangles all over the sky around us. A triangle formed closely above us and slowly lowered closer. I got strange sensations watching it and had a surge of adrenaline. It was absolutely mesmerizing and captivating. Ajay and I both felt extremely calm and relaxed. We were in a trance like state. They were only like 25ft above us. I instinctively did deep intense breathing as the mesmerizing triangle got closer, they put me in an altered state I haven\u2019t experienced before. Felt like being hypnotized. They had a strong presence. I\u2019m not even sure how to describe the feelings I had but it was very nice. It felt like time slowed down. Ajay grabbed his phone to take a video and they stopped moving. It was like we both had to be focused on them, and I think they didn\u2019t want to be photographed. He couldn\u2019t capture them on his video and for the next 2 hours they stayed in that same spot above us. \n\nWe watched from 10:30-12:15 but we both swore it had only been 30-45 minutes. Time was passing extremely fast, we both agreed it felt about 3 times too fast. That probably had to do with our trance state. We\u2019ve been having trouble getting along for a while and this experience really healed our friendship (at least for now lol). The longer we watched together the closer I felt to my roommate. At the start I was trying not to get annoyed by him and by the end my resentment towards him was gone and replaced by lots of love and connection. I felt cuddly and affectionate from watching them, I really wanted a hug from the orbs.\n\nAt one point Ajay went inside for a few minutes and I was excited to have private experiences with the orbs but I didn\u2019t see any till he returned. I felt so calm and happy and grateful watching them, strangely those feelings weakened when my roommate wasn\u2019t with me. I had felt like the orbs were for me since I\u2019m a regular experiencer. I got over this selfish feeling and realized they were for both of us and our shared experience. Right after Ajay came back outside I told him how they went away when he left and that the energy weren\u2019t as good alone and in that second Ajay saw what looked like an orange shooting star quickly dart close to us. It happened in half a second and I didn\u2019t see it. I believe it was responding to my words. He said it looked like something out of Star Wars. \n\nAjay has better eyesight than me and saw faint blue lines connecting a triangle of orbs. He also saw a single moving orb disappear into a magnetic field or something. He said it looked like the ufo entered a strange cloud. We saw a few duplicate and shape-shift. Some just looked like lights and others looked like crafts. A couple rotated while moving. We both felt so calm and peaceful during and after watching them. It was such intense calm that I\u2019m not used to. \n\nThey\u2019re out basically all night every night. I tried keeping my mind receptive to messages and tried to send out messages but didn\u2019t get anything. We both felt addicted to watching them and had to force ourselves to go to bed. We were still in a nice trance after watching.", "report_date": "2025-05-28T12:43:03+00:00", "sighting_id": 188, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": null, "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.0, "parsing_quality": "unknown", "duration_seconds": 12, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "142", "weather_conditions": "Clear sky, Cloud cover: 0%, Wind: 3.7m/s, Temp: 14.9\u00b0C, Humidity: 58%"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-73.9442, 40.6782]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1nsmc3i/unidentified_flying_object/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 40.6782, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -73.9442, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/85u257oz8wrf1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-09-27T23:00:00+00:00", "description": "Unidentified flying object\nDid anyone else see this over New York?

Initially thought it might be a drone or weather balloon, but the object moved **smoothly slowly and rapidly at times** \u2014with no visible means of propulsion, no wings, and no sound.\n\nIt seemed to reflect sunlight strongly, as if it had a **mirror-like surface**, and appeared **perfectly spherical** with no seams or appendages visible. The size is hard to estimate precisely, but compared to nearby treetops and based on distance, I\u2019d guess it was roughly 1\u20132 meters in diameter and hovered at around 300\u2013500 meters altitude.\n\n# Analysis & What I\u2019ve Ruled Out:\n\n* **Not a drone:** Too large and completely silent, even when it moved quickly.\n* **Not a weather balloon:** Too reflective, too fast in motion, and it changed direction slightly mid-flight.\n* **Not CGI:** Footage is raw from the source\n* **Not a plane or bird:** No wings, no sound, not organic in movement.\n\n# Additional Notes:\n\n* No EM interference or strange behavior noticed during or after the sighting.\n* Location is remote, near pastureland and jungle\u2014no known military facilities nearby.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nObserved a highly reflective, silent metallic sphere hovering then moving across the Colombian countryside.

It may interact with objects and is sometimes seen emerging from lakes or enclosed spaces.\n\n**Page 2-4: LIGHT CHARACTERISTICS**\n\nMost sightings fall into specific color categories:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Blue, red, violet, yellow, and variations of these colors.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Sometimes surrounded by bluish envelopes, [emitting sparks or fireworks-like trails](https://youtu.be/fpIdQ7k_w9Y?si=Kgh96CAaF6ItIdKT) , and exhibiting glowing tentacles.\n\nBall lightning may leave smoky trails or [emit bright flashes](https://youtu.be/LYSuZeWzmPI?si=VtnzCGcEnpOsI_B9) , sometimes pulsating with color or [creating misty appearances](https://youtu.be/IBL3v-T5MSo?si=8PrsfLmc1LPwzfPM) \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThere are multiple other research papers presenting similar video evidence like the [Extraterrestrial Life in the Thermosphere: Plasmas, UAP, Pre-Life, Fourth State of Matter](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=131506#return211) that studied the [NASA STS missions](https://youtu.be/rYtn6lgdXhg?si=libnbkz5gKH_AvD6) - quoting the different astronaut sightings, and measuring the trajectory of what is on video showing their nonlinear flight path, consuming one another and changing speed. ***Its undeniable***\nAlso the recent [Tedesco Brothers](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=135539) who also have compelling video evidence and data supporting their findings, here\u2019s a [Interview](https://youtu.be/yjQX4XPw7Bg?si=cxsaJIyByq75zo_g)\n\nThere are also several YouTube channels that have been filming the same types of anomalies that Jake Barber and the Skywatcher team have recently been showcasing\u2014anomalies that match the characteristics and features described in numerous research papers on atmospheric coherent plasma. The key difference is that these videos are extremely high quality, with thousands of recordings available.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice strong similarities to the black-and-white thermal footage released by the DoD and other government agencies. However, the major distinction is that these civilian-captured videos are in color\u2014which is a significant detail. When we examine UFO footage taken by civilians, we often see vibrant colors and behaviors that don\u2019t align with traditional aircraft\u2014exactly what these channels are showing, including footage of [smaller objects emerging from larger ones](https://youtu.be/0nDAO_olxGM?si=czfBhowHLH7wHUeI)\n\nI want to add before anyone calls bullcrap (because they see a number). The researcher explains exactly why that is [Which he explains and demonstrates here](https://youtu.be/QeAbuBsYP5c?si=xV1n8oYTJtR0FAmq) and it\u2019s because he writes it on the ground with big Plywood boards** - ***You are seeing mimickry*** This is not a new feature\u2014many researchers and whistleblowers have noted that this phenomenon can mimic or imitate elements in its environment.\n\nHere are some channels:\n\n [Plasmoid Anomalies Study Group](https://youtube.com/@miamiufo?si=jrOlLmEqTEywsp1u)\n\n[Mr Anonymous](https://youtube.com/@skywatcheranomalous89?si=Cpr7bGT7eSymBfdf)\n\n[Jay C Aerial Anomalies](https://youtube.com/@ufojonathancastro?si=ImVcCZo__LS2YQo3)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting this phenomenon has been studied since the 1950s by **Trevor James Constable*** (1925\u20132016), a **radio officer in the U.S. Merchant Marine** during and after World War II which gave him a strong background in **electronics, radio waves, and atmospheric conditions**. He was one of the first to detect these anomalies during the war. After his service, he dedicated his life to this field. I highly recommend his books:\n\n***They Live in the Sky!*** (1958)\n\n***The Cosmic Pulse of Life*** (1976)\n\n***Sky Creatures: Living UFOs*** (1978)\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThere\u2019s much more to cover, including topics like consciousness, ESP (which, if you recall, **Ben Rich**, former director of Lockheed Martin\u2019s Skunk Works said **\u201cit\u2019s all about ESP\u201d**), and the reported telepathic connections between experiencers and non-human intelligences. I\u2019d also love to touch on free energy\u2014but I\u2019ll leave it there for now!\n\nSome closing thoughts,  It\u2019s very telling how deeply manipulation and programmed cognitive dissonance have been successfully implemented in the public at large. Critical thinking and independent research are almost frowned upon. Most people won\u2019t even entertain an idea they instinctively disagree with\u2014essentially boxing themselves in from ever gaining a different perspective. Unless the talking heads bring it up and hold their hand saying, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to think this now,\u201d they won\u2019t budge. It\u2019s sad, really.\n\nI say this because I\u2019ve brought this information in front of this sub before and was immediately met with pushback. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of verifiable evidence I share\u2014the reaction is almost always the same.\n\nI\u2019m hoping that with this new whistleblower confirming the Immaculate Constellation document, more of you will take a second look at the corroborating evidence across other sources and cases, and begin to form a fuller picture.\n\nAs I stated at the start: the evidence is all there. This community often complains about \u201cdrip disclosure,\u201d but in reality, you can build the picture yourself with the information already available.", "report_date": "2025-05-16T17:45:35+00:00", "sighting_id": 154, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": "Video links: ['https://youtu.be/wO12cZgcwiU?si=1ST3nqMwjv4Yuah-)', 'https://youtu.be/W7u2AExzxlY?si=CI5wmGz8J7OQPDNP)', 'https://youtu.be/M7-FPUUB0pM?si=YJUgJL3VpyrJRjYC),', 'https://youtu.be/uKwaisvrOiA?si=Vn2-c0aqNZsMVuMc', 'https://youtu.be/DlobtrHXPlQ?si=Tuuw9Z2D6OCCrg-Y)', 'https://youtu.be/vhENiRD5A8o?si=2dPwI9EulVnV7mK0)', 'https://youtu.be/iptzQVRb-Xs?si=nfj3521VcoBZm0cY)', 'https://youtu.be/NlbW3zOc1VY?si=ffBe4502e62g1skz)', 'https://youtu.be/FGtQcztIZCU?si=i1FYkgORJC56S1zK)', 'https://youtu.be/r_D3Thw-5pI?si=lP8kPcsslv7ic8OC)', 'https://youtu.be/jfcQPQM9nvU?si=JuObMoKv4MXnY1Mg)', 'https://youtu.be/fpIdQ7k_w9Y?si=Kgh96CAaF6ItIdKT)', 'https://youtu.be/LYSuZeWzmPI?si=VtnzCGcEnpOsI_B9)', 'https://youtu.be/IBL3v-T5MSo?si=8PrsfLmc1LPwzfPM)', 'https://youtu.be/rYtn6lgdXhg?si=libnbkz5gKH_AvD6)', 'https://youtu.be/yjQX4XPw7Bg?si=cxsaJIyByq75zo_g)', 'https://youtu.be/0nDAO_olxGM?si=czfBhowHLH7wHUeI)', 'https://youtu.be/QeAbuBsYP5c?si=xV1n8oYTJtR0FAmq)']", "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.0, "parsing_quality": "unknown", "duration_seconds": 32, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "29496", "weather_conditions": "Overcast, Cloud cover: 99%, Wind: 26.1m/s, Temp: 15.8\u00b0C, Humidity: 44%"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-101.8371192, 35.20729]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1jxxq7q/can_anyone_explain_this/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 35.20729, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -101.8371192, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/64l9iej6liue1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-04-13T02:00:00+00:00", "description": "Can anyone explain this?\nI saw it while walking my dog, no clue what it is.\nTime: 9 pm \nLocation: Amarillo Texas", "report_date": "2025-04-12T19:36:20+00:00", "sighting_id": 46, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": null, "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.0, "parsing_quality": "unknown", "duration_seconds": 38, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "20", "weather_conditions": "Clear sky, Cloud cover: 0%, Wind: 19.4m/s, Temp: 26.0\u00b0C, Humidity: 12%"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-71.9785356, -13.5170887]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1knmtfn/possible_uap_cusco_peru/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": -13.5170887, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -71.9785356, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/tq9vxnet711f1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-04-19T00:46:00+00:00", "description": "Possible UAP, Cusco Peru\nTime: 18th april 7:46PM\n\nLocation: Cusco, Peru\n\nI recorded this video while I was on my rooftop watching the stars, when I noticed one that was moving kind of strangely.

Every clear night, usually around 8 or 9 pm. I live in CT and started watching the night sky almost every night for a little bit around this time ever since the whole drone thing. I started this back in November, and like I already said I only started seeing these orbs in February. So it was highly unusual to me.\n\nI have the FlightRadar app and can see all the planes, helicopters, etc. and know what those lights look like. Some military craft like Chinooks, Globemasters, Blackhawks show up on the app, but I have seen some F22 Raptors during the day that don't show up on the app so I know some unregistered craft will not show up. So I am wondering if these things I'm seeing are UFO or just secret military craft?\n\nI also thought of satellites, but whenever I searched that up it says there are no satellites visible from my area and times where one may be visible are few and far between. And from what I've seen online this behavior does not match. I have seen literally 20+ of them in the span of 30 minutes some nights, no way they are satellites?\n\nMore details: these orbs vary in dimness/brightness, but all seem to go about the same speed. They come and go from various directions across the sky and usually disappear over the horizon, but I have seen a few fade out! Also I noticed a trend where the majority of them will come from the treeline in the West of my yard.\n\nI don't have a good camera, these videos were taken on an iPhone 13, otherwise I would have taken more videos but the dim ones barely show up. I can see them much better with my naked eye.\n\nThe first video (first minute 23 secs) shows one of the brightest ones I have ever seen (compare it to the stars, it's much brighter!) and then another one I saw right after that was about the same brightness as the stars.\n\nThe second video shows two travelling almost parallel to each other, and then I saw two more that were quite dim and you can barely make them out in the video.\n\nPlease help me figure out what these are!

On Tuesday, April 29th at 20:37, what I\u2019ve been waiting for over many years happened.\nAround 30 objects flew towards Oslo. I filmed them from a small town called Brevik as they flew over Bunnefjorden heading in the direction of Oslo. Most were flying without any kind of formation, but about 10 of them were flying in a formation a bit farther away and higher up in the sky.\nI managed to film the first ones I saw. I\u2019d estimate they were the size of a large refrigerator, maybe a bit bigger. Unfortunately, the camera doesn\u2019t capture how clearly visible they were to the naked eye, and in the footage it looks like they\u2019re much farther away.\n\nThey were all within our atmosphere, and we saw them crystal clear.\n\nCheck the video! There are two a bit higher up on the screen, and one a bit further down. (It also seems like uploading here on Facebook makes the video quality worse and blurrier, but you can still see them quite clearly.)\n\nDid anyone else see these?\n\n-------\n\nI also want to add myself that In Oslo around the same time, me and my friends spotted a single silver orb heading from east to west, seen north from Oslo.\n\nI have my own video of that event.

On this occasion I had a golden orb streak across the sky, heading from the north west to the south east well below the clouds, but above the tree tops and disappear in the sky, but not from out of sight more like it made itself, not want to be visible to me.\n\nI have had sightings of these orbs many many times, if you were to search my history on this page, I\u2019ve had quite lengthy posts with plenty of documentaries of these objects rather long winded descriptions with many supporting videos.\n\nHaving had this happen before I have noticed the pattern of these orbs, seeming to go into the woods across the street from my house. Sometimes they remain visible to the naked eye. Sometimes they do not sometimes they are visible under IR sometimes they are not. In the event they are not visible by IR. I purchased myself an RSX thermal monocular, that is what this footage is recorded with.  \nI believe I\u2019m witnessing is this orb seems to have landed on top of a tree structure, but not on a large branch, I have footage of owls in the woods raccoons on trees. They are always on a sturdy piece of wood this one is not. What I believe we are witnessing in this video is one of these plasma orb creatures somehow splitting another orb off of itself.  That\u2019s the large ejection effect, if you slow down the speed I believe you can also see smaller orbs eject upwards.\n\nI am going to also post some supporting videos in the comments with a brief description.

I\u2019m a software engineer and developed a AI-based sky detection camera. I posted about it in here awhile ago. I often capture anomalies, but most are minor, like a faint flash or a stationary blinking object, and could easily be explained. This one is different though. \n\nI reviewed the footage and noticed that had flagged four meteorites within roughly 1.5 seconds, an extremely rare detection, and is bucketed as an anomaly. \n\nInterestingly, I later found a post on Reddit (r/BucksCountyPa) and a post in (r/Portlandme) that both are from the same date and time. The Maine post is relevant because the camera faces 68\u00b0 east and the slight left turn the object makes puts the trajectory roughly towards the New England states. The poster who in PA stated:\n\n\u201cI looked up and there was this sporadic, flashing light, quickly moving left to right, fast, then gone, in a space that didn\u2019t have cloud cover.\u201d\n\nThe poster in the r/Portlandme group wasn\u2019t too descriptive but comments in the thread stated it looked like a comet but \u201ccomets don\u2019t disappear\u201d, and these descriptions appear to match. \n\nAlthough I can\u2019t confirm if these sightings were related, the timing and descriptions of both posts are remarkably similar to mine. For how fast the object is moving, it\u2019s not far fetched in my opinion that these sightings could be related. \n\nThe object itself is weird, each flash points towards the next.

The object appeared to spin or reflect light as it moved silently across the sky. There was no engine noise, no wings, and no visible propellers.\n\nCurious about what it might be, I ran the footage through a series of AI enhancements and analyses:\n\n\t\u2022\tFrame Extraction & Enhancement: Pulled stills from the video, zoomed in, boosted contrast, and sharpened the frames. The object consistently appeared smooth and geometric.\n\t\u2022\tShape Analysis: Edge detection and circle/cigar fitting revealed the object wasn\u2019t irregular like a balloon. In most frames, it had a 2:1 aspect ratio, suggesting an elongated, tic-tac-like form.\n\t\u2022\tMotion Analysis: Differences between frames showed the object moved as a single stable unit\u2014not drifting erratically like debris. It also didn\u2019t leave trails or smears typical of camera artifacts.\n\t\u2022\tSpectral-like Processing: By isolating RGB channels, boosting faint detail with contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and applying false-color maps, subtle highlights appeared to shift along the surface. This supported the impression of rotation or a reflective surface.\n\t\u2022\tOutlines & Artistic Rendering: Automated outlines confirmed its elongation. Since video stabilization was tricky in the dark, I had an artistic rendering made to represent what it likely looked like: a smooth, glowing tic-tac/cigar-shaped object in the night sky.\n\nWhat it isn\u2019t (likely):\n\t\u2022\tDrone: No sound, no rotor halo, no blinking lights.\n\t\u2022\tBalloon: Didn\u2019t tumble or distort, held a clean geometric shape.\n\t\u2022\tLens Artifact: It moved across the sky relative to background stars, not stuck in the same place like a camera flare.\n\nWhat it could be:\nAt the very least, this qualifies as a UAP\u2014an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Its silence, smooth elongated form, consistent motion, and spinning reflection all line up more with the \u201ctic-tac\u201d UAPs described in Navy encounters than with everyday explanations.\n\nMy question to the community:\nHas anyone else in Arizona seen similar silent, spinning, elongated objects recently?

Since things have been intensifying of late and I am witnessing more and more strange phenomena, I have been feeling this increasing sense of responsibility, that I really shouldn't keep this information to myself but that I ought to alert the public to what I have seen over the past 7 months.\nI have been trying to decide where and how it would be best to start sharing my experiences and video footage and quite frankly I have been overwhelmed until tonight when I came across this forum and I thought \"Cat, damn it just make a start and get your info out there, this seems to be a great forum, just do it, choose a video make your first post, it'll get easier from then on!\"\nSo that's where we are at, I hope you bear with me, I am new to this, I may make mistakes, I am happy to receive feedback on how to do things better.\n\nSo, as I already mentioned in my heading, about 7 months ago I started to see strange light phenomena in the night sky, from the balcony of my apartment, overlooking the city of Wuppertal here in Germany. Since my first sighting I have observed various strange objects, orbs, triangles, moving stars, drone like blinking lights appearing in the skies, and in the woods and treelines all around my apartment  almost every single night.\nFortunately I have been able to capture these objects on camera which I am going to share with you in this forum.\nI will actually attach my first video to this post.\nI feel that that the activity I have been observing  is increasing and a couple of weeks ago I saw something  quite unnerving. What I saw is difficult to desribe, I think the best description would be that I saw an interdimensional being standing on the roof of on of the neighbouring houses. Since then I have been becoming more and more aware of cloaked entities all around my neighbourhood, I am aware that this sounds a little unhinged. I promise you I am quite normal. What does concern me is that it feels like that we are building up to some kind of major event. Can anybody relate to what I am saying? Has anybody had similar experiences? I would love to hear from you.\n\nNow the first video I chose is one of the first sightings I had in January of this year. My apartment has two balconies on the opposite site of the building one overlooking the city, and the other overlooking the back garden/ park area. This one was taken from the balcony overlooking the garden area, in the video clip you can see where the treeline is. You will notice that I am focusing the camera on one of the objects only,  the reason for this is that I didn't actually know that there was a second object in the sky as it only became visible on film and couldn't be seen with the naked eye at the time of filming. You will also notice me saying hello and speaking to the objects, this may sound weird but right from the start I had this feeling that I was able to communicate with these UFOs on some level. The footage is unedited apart from me slightly brightning the background to improve visibility.", "report_date": "2025-08-12T04:33:59+00:00", "sighting_id": 330, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": "Parsing: ai_parser, TZ: explicit_utc, Date conf: 0.85, Loc conf: 0.90", "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.85, "parsing_quality": "ai_parser", "duration_seconds": 60, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "17", "weather_conditions": "Light drizzle, Cloud cover: 100%, Wind: 9.6m/s, Temp: 0.4\u00b0C, Humidity: 99%"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-99.4532707, 39.7998004]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1nlpvup/black_tic_tac_phasing_through_storm/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 39.7998004, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -99.4532707, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/1wsn8kjba9qf1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-08-23T23:00:00+00:00", "description": "Black tic tac phasing through storm\nDate and time: 23rd August 25, 6pm\nLocation: Nabraska US\n\nCaptured this by accident while looking at a white orb(included in video), had to slow it down x24 as very fast.

I had a 14 hour film shoot the day before so I was surprised my body woke me up so early given how exhausted I was. Usually when I wake up around this time I will go for a run around the block, I thought that it might make me feel better and help me fall back asleep again if I went on a quick one. \n\nThings were going as they usually do until I felt this warmth in my stomach, just as I notice my stomach warming up I feel the urge to vomit and then do so. The second I\u2019m done throwing up I look up into the sky to catch my breathe and there was a red orb doing all sorts of absolutely mind bending maneuvers. It was whizzing around the sky in a sort of zig zag diagonal pattern. It was so hard to not notice that I started to wipe my eyes due to me thinking clearly they must have been watering having just thrown up, but no, dry as a bone. I don\u2019t suffer from astigmatism and have 20/20 vision, this thing was clear as day. \n\nAfter standing there dumbstruck I pull out my phone to record it. The SECOND and I mean the literal second that I switched to my camera on my phone (not opening my phone but right as I switched to the camera app) it slowed down and just disappeared. I managed to get the orb and it disappearing on camera. \n\nAs you can hear In the video I probably sound pretty nasally given the 2 events happened right after each other and I had almost no time to process what the fuck just happened.

After the short video, I was almost across the bridge and started seeing it make some weird tumbling maneuver to which made it seem to start tumbling away at a pretty fast speed.

I recall one instance driving in the car with my father one day when out of nowhere he turns to me and says \u201cThey are real ya know , they walk among us\u201d and thinking he was joking until he pressed further, explaining the greys and supposed human like aliens that live in the mountains.  I\u2019ve asked him about this recently and he says he does not remember having that conversation with me.  I was, however, interested in astral projection, OBE\u2019s, lucid dreaming, and had a period of psychedelic experiences with the intention of \u201cexpanding consciousness.\u201d \nRecently I began similar meditation practices with the addition of the gateway tapes and started consuming the plethora of phenomena related content online.  \n\nOn to the actual event:\nDate and Time: 1/17/25 about 4:30-4:50pm \nLocation:  New Haven, Connecticut \n\nI had been talking on FaceTime with a friend of mine who I frequently shot the shit with about esoteric topics.  I was driving, and stuck in some backroad traffic due to a police detour and a block they had sectioned off.  I comment on the traffic and state that \u201csomeone must have gotten shot\u201d (common in that area) however I really wanted to make a joke about a UFO crashing.  5 or so minutes later, I\u2019ve repeated this comment 3 times and now frustrated with the traffic and decide to make light of the situation.  \u201cMaybe a UFO crashes, HA..Ha\u2026ha\u201d I said in a sarcastic manner.  Within 10 seconds, this ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE eerie looking craft starts flying directly above my car and the traffic towards the shoreline.  It was maybe 200-300ft in the air, and the size of a small building? It was fucking huge. To the best of my recollection, the craft seemed to be put together with an obscene amount of smaller pieces.  It had this \u201csteampunk\u201d look.  At the same time I had no idea what I was looking at. The shape was either close to a cross or T, not even close to the traditional flying saucer.  The most noticeable aspect was the set of glowing orange orbs that seemed to be its propulsion method. There were 6-8, lining the base of the ship in the shape of a diamond or cross, in a way similar to the supposed TR-3B mockups online.  This, might have looked like what one would suspect a TR-6 or 8B to look like. \nI started screaming to my friend that there actually was indeed a UFO in the fucking sky and I was absolutely losing my shit.  I even stick my head out of the window while inching forward bumper to bumper, yelling at the other drivers asking if anyone else saw what I was seeing.  This was blowing my mind and my buddy was telling me to take a video.  My phones lagging due to low battery mode, it\u2019s on FaceTime and wouldn\u2019t let me record a video, and was connected to CarPlay so by the time I got my fucking camera on it the craft had nearly vanished into the horizon.  But I caught that video.  It\u2019s shitty af I know, and I hate myself for not having better proof of this story, but sometimes when I question myself as to whether or not that even happened, I pull out that video and it reminds me how out of this world that moment was.  \n\nI eventually submitted a MUFON report because I had no idea who to contact about the experience.  A field investigator by the name of Dave Champagne reached out and interviewed me which was somewhat useful as it did end up confirming that it was an \u201cunknown.\u201d  He checked the metadata in the video and told me what time it had actually happened as I guessed in the initial report.  He also told me that a medical helicopter had been dispatched to rescue someone in that area of New Haven, which explained the blocked off road however we both concluded that I didn\u2019t simply mistake a helicopter for a UFO.  I have seen helicopters fly low to the ground and can confirm this was not what I saw and captured on video. He said the case remained open due to not being able to verify its identity, however I have tried to view the case on the MUFON website and cannot seem to access it, nor any other case so maybe I\u2019m just doing something wrong, or maybe I\u2019m locked out somehow.  I have a drawing that I drew that night so that I wouldn\u2019t forget what it looked like , but it\u2019s not great and my memory wasn\u2019t great due to the short glimpse up close.  I can try and attach it through the comments as it won\u2019t let me post two attachments.\n\nI\u2019ve become rather fixated on this subject since, and spend much of my time meditating with the gateway tapes and looking into the sky.  So far this has been my only sighting that was not merely odd lights in the sky maneuvering in strange ways.  It feels like it wasn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d since it happened so quickly and due to the fact that I seemed to sense its presence wanting to make a joke about a UFO and it seemingly appearing out of nowhere immediately after.  \n\nThanks for taking the time to read.", "report_date": "2025-07-30T02:49:42+00:00", "sighting_id": 317, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": "Date conf: 0.95; Timezone: UTC (explicit)", "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.0, "parsing_quality": "unknown", "duration_seconds": 98, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "7", "weather_conditions": "Clear sky, Cloud cover: 18%, Wind: 5.5m/s, Temp: 0.6\u00b0C, Humidity: 79%"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-8.611, 41.1335]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1meh3bl/what_could_this_be/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 41.1335, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -8.611, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/v2qemugcpagf1/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-07-31T22:48:00+00:00", "description": "What could this be?\nA friend of mine just recorded this tonight.

Since the sightings in New Jersey, since January I've been seeing orbs in the sky here and even jellyfish during the day, and simply no one is talking about it.\n\nGuys, please, there's something really big going on. I also can't stop dreaming about sightings. Now that I've seen that you can't even trust the stars in the sky, I'm definitely going to sleep with one eye open.

At first, I saw a metallic spherical object flying eastward above the water surface from the west side of the reservoir. At that time, it seemed to hover occasionally before continuing to fly, and it disappeared behind a hill. I initially thought it was just a strange hydrogen balloon and didn\u2019t pay much attention.\n\nAround 7:30 PM, as I was about to head back, the sphere reappeared in the south. There was no wind at all, and the evening was very quiet. Surprisingly, the sphere was able to fly at varying altitudes, hovering midway before continuing to fly. I watched for a few minutes and became certain it was definitely not a balloon or a drone. I then started filming, but the object was strange\u2014every time I filmed for a short while, it would move behind the trees. Whenever I thought it had completely disappeared, it would reappear. This continued intermittently for over ten minutes, during which I recorded three video clips. After the last clip, it disappeared completely.\n\nIn the following days, I saw a video online of a similar sphere flying over Colombia, which looked very much like what I saw. That\u2019s when I decided to seek help online for identification.\"", "report_date": "2025-06-16T11:45:59+00:00", "sighting_id": 229, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": "Date conf: 0.95; Timezone: UTC (explicit)", "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.0, "parsing_quality": "unknown", "duration_seconds": 41, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "923", "weather_conditions": "Clear sky, Cloud cover: 2%, Wind: 8.9m/s, Temp: 35.3\u00b0C, Humidity: 19%"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [153.0251, -27.4698]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1md2rmz/ufo_with_tail_of_light_captured_tonight_in/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": -27.4698, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": 153.0251, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/y1dlm8cglzff1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-07-29T08:23:00+00:00", "description": "UFO with tail of light captured tonight in Brisbane, Australia.

Plane maybe?\nLocation: West Side, Albuquerque New Mexico, US, exactly on Paseo Del Norte and Golf Course RD. \nTime: 10:38AM\n\nThis morning I was driving in Abq with my girlfriend, who doesn\u2019t believe in UAPS at all btw. \n\nI was going on Paseo Del Norte which is a road that goes east to west in Abq NM, and I was going east when I noticed something strange in the sky at exactly 10:35AM. The reason why I say strange is because it was too white, too bright, and usually planes don\u2019t look that bright and big when they are that far away, this looked more narrow than a plane, and moving in a strange way, it appeared to be moving northeast in a way that didn\u2019t seem consistent with typical aircraft propulsion, and it stood out due to its brightness and size despite its apparent distance\n\nWhen I first noticed the object I told my gf but she couldn\u2019t see it, and later when we stopped at a red light she saw it, which is when I started recording, but this time it was moving west, I could be wrong, but again, when I first saw it, I noticed way closer and it was going northeast, Unfortunately the red light changed to green and she told me to chase it, so we chased it, we lost it and in about 6 minutes later we saw it again, suspended in the exact same spot that we saw it earlier, again, airplanes don\u2019t stay suspended up in the sky. I\u2019m not saying that this is 100% a UAP, I checked the flight tracker app to see if there were flights going east to west at that time, but didn\u2019t see anything, if someone could dig dipper in the app that\u2019d be appreciated. Since I have no proofs or a recording that can for sure identified what it is I\u2019ll call it a plane, but trust me, it looked weird, it moved weird, it shinned weird, and even my gf calls it her first UAP sighting.

But I had a clear view of it with my eyes before going in to grab my phone. \n\nTravelling at a steady speed and direction, heading west to east ish.\n\nWay to low and to bright in the sky to be a satellite, completely silent, no flashing lights. \n\nI've uploaded the raw video straight from my phone. \n\nThis is my third observation of something unexplained in sky over the last couple of weeks,  all of them just like this, except I see it zoom off into the horizon or up into high altitude. But never been able to capture anything before on my phone. \n\nBeen a long time follower of the subject, and for my sins I'm a smoker! That spends a lot of time stood outside on my own looking up at the sky. I'm familiar with what's up there, I can point out Venus, mars, Saturn etc, and I can follow Orion and other stars across the sky as time passes.  I'm familiar with a flight path that comes across the sky in the opposite direction southeast to northwest from the near by airport in Luton, you can see the aircraft at different altitudes with blinking lights. I've watched satellite cross the sky for over 10 years, way before starlink, and so I'm very familiar with what a satellite is, you can even see the point at which one disappears in the sky  once it's beyond the horizon of the sun light. Because it's the sun's reflection off of the satellite in orbit, not a light. It is none of these things. \n\nI know it's only a blurry light in the sky again, but I have a pixel 9 pro one of the best phones in the market., it's about as good as we are going to get at night in low light. But say, this is my third experience now, I'm actively going to be more prepared and have my phone ready to go. Had I captured it going across the entire sky rather than just before we lost it behind the trees, it would have been a much better contribution to the sub.\n\nWhat do you guys think?!

At first, I saw a metallic spherical object flying eastward above the water surface from the west side of the reservoir. At that time, it seemed to hover occasionally before continuing to fly, and it disappeared behind a hill. I initially thought it was just a strange hydrogen balloon and didn\u2019t pay much attention.\n\nAround 7:30 PM, as I was about to head back, the sphere reappeared in the south. There was no wind at all, and the evening was very quiet. Surprisingly, the sphere was able to fly at varying altitudes, hovering midway before continuing to fly. I watched for a few minutes and became certain it was definitely not a balloon or a drone. I then started filming, but the object was strange\u2014every time I filmed for a short while, it would move behind the trees. Whenever I thought it had completely disappeared, it would reappear. This continued intermittently for over ten minutes, during which I recorded three video clips. After the last clip, it disappeared completely.\n\nIn the following days, I saw a video online of a similar sphere flying over Colombia, which looked very much like what I saw. That\u2019s when I decided to seek help online for identification.\"", "report_date": "2025-06-19T13:11:20+00:00", "sighting_id": 236, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": "Date conf: 0.95; Timezone: UTC (explicit)", "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.0, "parsing_quality": "unknown", "duration_seconds": 118, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "2860", "weather_conditions": "Clear sky, Cloud cover: 2%, Wind: 8.9m/s, Temp: 35.3\u00b0C, Humidity: 19%"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-73.991, 40.76]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1kzl254/whats_in_the_sky_nyc_52925/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 40.76, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -73.991, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/81yskgzer04f1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-05-30T00:47:00+00:00", "description": "What\u2019s in the sky?

My initial thoughts were a plane way off the usual flight path however as we got closer what I first thought was a plane to my surprise was almost identical to the size and structure of a Blackhawk style helicopter therefore really catching my attention as I thought someone was about to have swat team sliding down ropes onto their roof. The reason to thinking this was a plane was due to the white, red and slight green/aqua lights however rather then moving like a plane it appeared to be hovering left and right similar to that of a helicopter. As we got closer and closer to the lights it was soon clear that this wasn\u2019t a plane nor a helicopter. The best way to describe what we seen was a drone the size of a helicopter. In the whole excitement and surprise of the moment I took out my phone to record a video of what we were seeing, at this same moment I begun recording the lights slowly disappeared underneath the rooflines of the houses to the right of us. (Video attached) Right after the video clip ended we turned down the street to where this thing had looked to have landed however after spending 45 minutes circling every street within a 3km radius however this thing had just disappeared into the night leaving us confused with no answers but a small video clip to try and convince anyone that I wasn\u2019t going crazy.

They first started off parallel to each other before I was able to start recording and despite them appearing to be going the same speed one of the objects was traveling farther than the other. From below they resembled horseshoe crabs and didn\u2019t have wings so I immediately knew they weren\u2019t birds along with the fact that they were higher than any birds I usually see and were actually higher up than a plane passing nearby.

This one is the middle one. \n\nBasically long story short, orbs were coming and going all over the sky and then after this video I saw a bright flash in the sky and it got super bright in that section of the sky behind the trees in my back yard. Then more orbs were moving slowly around the bright area. \n\nOk so in this video just as I saw the orb you see first, it was slowly moving across the sky, but as soon as I started recording it sped up and zoomed across the sky and hovered above the trees where I could still see it. It looks faster than it was because I literally had to turn myself 180 degrees just so I didn\u2019t lose it in the sky. As it\u2019s hovering, a second one comes out from behind the trees and seems like it goes right through the first one\u2026\n\nI could only film one so I stayed with the second one because it was moving. The first one just hovered where it stopped and they met up, and when I looked back after I lost the other one behind my house, it was gone.\n\nI know I know\u2026 TLDR!

Duration: 30 minutes. Number of witnesses: two people, two cameras. Description of sighting: I filmed anomalous orbs in four clips in one night with my Sony RX10 Mk. IV and a Wyze Cam V4\n\nThis is a compilation of my best footage since I gained renewed interest in skywatching last fall. The footage features anomalous objects filmed at dusk, night and dawn around the Oregon Country Fairgrounds and surrounding areas. Anything I choose to upload has been cross-checked via three or more of the listed databases in the acknowledgments, to rule out the vast majority of human activity. All footage is from one of three locations- a lot just south of hwy 126, west of Countryside Pizza,  my street, just north of the Oregon Country Fair, and once from a car driving south on territorial, towards Countryside Pizza.\n\nThese objects exhibit change in heading and velocity, all the way from outclassing other aircraft to stopping midair. They do not behave like any publicly-known satellite or aircraft. They cross paths with one or more other (usually smaller) objects flying intersecting, tightly overlapping routes. Modern propulsion systems cannot explain their behavior.\n\nThey carry no legally required lighting and run no types of transponder, exemptions for which are exceedingly rare. Using just my footage, an extremely frequent repeat route can be established- on most nights, into morning, at least one object will slowly pass west-to-east over the fairgrounds, usually several. \n\nThese objects vary greatly in color, size, behavior, and grouping, often traveling in perfectly interlocked pairs and triangle formations, moving in unison. \n\nThis compilation icludes footage recorded on a Sony RX10 Mk.IV  camera (4K video), a Fimi Mini 3 Drone (4k Video), A Sony IMX678 Starvis2 box camera with a 5-50 mm cs mount varifocal lens (4k video), A full-color & infrared night vision camera with a Sony \"starlight\" sensor and 15x zoom (4k Video), a Google Pixel 7 (4k video), a Wyze Cam V4 (2.5k video), and a Rettru Q8S Starlight color night vision security camera (1080p video). \nEnjoy, much more to come", "report_date": "2025-04-14T01:47:51+00:00", "sighting_id": 48, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": null, "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.0, "parsing_quality": "unknown", "duration_seconds": null, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "727", "weather_conditions": "Light drizzle, Cloud cover: 100%, Wind: 15.1m/s, Temp: 7.5\u00b0C, Humidity: 96%"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-77.43428, 37.5385087]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1kg9hot/glowing_orange_orb/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 37.5385087, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -77.43428, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/pmhs75rvy6ze1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-02-13T00:30:00+00:00", "description": "Glowing Orange Orb\nI was looking over the James River when I saw a solid, orange orb hovering over Manchester.

Open to ideas.\nTime: 8:05pm\n\nLocation: Henderson Nevada \n\nI don\u2019t like to jump to conclusions so I will keep it short and not add my speculation opting instead for just the facts of what I witnessed. I was on an evening walk with my mother when we both stopped talking and looked at a strange color changing orb in the sky. We both started to record and I managed to get the ball of light moving across the sky but just as I stopped recording and it started to vanish right in font of our eyes. \n\nAt the time I was not aware that my mom was still recording and she captured the object phasing out of visibility. In person in looked as if it cloaked but I don\u2019t want to speculate so it vanished is the simplest way I could put it. There was no sound and visible tail like a comet or shooting star. It was shifting colors and there was no haze or light scatter. It was moving steady but not super fast. \n\nThe videos do this no justice at all. It was so bright and vivid and moved as if there was no friction. I then recorded the airplanes flying around just to show how different the light from aircraft look as opposed to this object on camera let alone in person. I can post those for comparison if anyone wants to compare just let me know. All in all I\u2019m not sure what it is but neither of us can figure it out. You can see the aircraft and they are daily identifiable in the area we walk in so this stood out and was nothing like the rest of what we saw. If anyone has ideas or speculation don\u2019t hesitate chime in. \n\nBoth cameras capture a slightly different aspect as they zoom to different. The iPhone was able to get close but it still not close enough so it looked like a flashing dot.

The experience I am having is that these are healing light packets that are being sent down from UFOs. I sense at least a correlation between the appearance of these light packets and UFO appearances. The UFO associated is the one mainstream media calls \"5g SaTelLitEs\". This video is more evidence against the 5g SatelliTe HypotHeSis.\n\nThe experience I am having is that UFOs arrive, then maybe thirty minutes later these light packets fall out of the sky, then shortly after I perceive the ground as if subtly glowing and I have a warm healing feeling in my body. This has been happening very frequently since February. I have had old injuries healing, for example a should injury from 2007, seamingly healed. I believe these light packets are somehow involved. I am able to better receive these light packets by doing lotus pose or sun salutations, which stimulate the pineal gland, increasing reception. I believe something more complex is going on here, beyond the scope of this post.\n\nI'm aware this might sound \"crazy\", and is my subjective experience, but this is simply my honest narrative to accompany the video.\n\nThe sky has been swarming with UFOs in Castell del Rey since February, almost every night.

In all my years of sky watching,an obsession of more than two years, often spending one to three hours lying outside scanning the sky. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. I dedicate my full attention to the night sky, slowly scanning, watching, waiting, sometimes using binoculars for a closer look.\n\nWhat makes this especially strange is their constant flaring. I\u2019ve seen plenty of things in the sky and am used to surprises, but this is unbelievable: red, sometimes green or bluish white pulses of light that flare up and vanish.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this here for documentation.

I was walking to get my mail at 8:32PM and noticed the star Antares was incredibly bright and shimmering this night. Prior to recording I used the app SkyView to confirm that these were stars and they were part of the scorpio constellation. In this recording I am facing south-southwest (toward the scorpio constellation).\n\nI have never just recorded the sky like this. I have never recorded the sky and then reviewed my recording in the hopes of \u201cseeing something\u201d. However, last night I had the compulsion to take out my phone and record the sky, specifically the intensity of the \u201ctwinkling\u201d of Antares. In the recording, the two bright lights in the center are Antares and the other I dont recall.\n\nI am recording at the street looking back toward my house (south-southwest) and I am using my mailbox as a stabilizer. I am looking at the phone screen while I am recording and around second 23-24 I notice the white orb just appears out of (seemingly) nowhere.\n\nIt had the same luminosity as one of the smaller stars (less bright than Antares) and the luminosity was fixed (it was not twinkling or changing). It did not have red or green navigation lights. I ended the video to pull up flightradar and there was nothing in that direction. As I pulled up video again to start recording more it blinked out and disappeared. It was visible for about 45-60 seconds in total (about 20 seconds in the video and then another 20-30 seconds before disappearing). Initially I thought it might have been a satellite or something similar reappearing or disappearing behind cloud cover. I stayed outside for another 5 minutes but saw no other abnormalities, then went back inside.\n\nPost Video Analysis\nThe next morning I sent the video to my BIL. It wasnt until this rewatching that I noticed the orb made some unusual movements (\u201cV\u201d shaped movements around 23-25 second mark). My description of the movement was lazy and deliberate. I did have an urge or sensation to start filming in the first place, which I find slightly unusual.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not totally sure why I stopped filming. I know flightradar has \u201crewind\u201d feature and I didn\u2019t need to stop filming. But somehow I felt compelled or wasn\u2019t thinking clearly enough to stop myself from recording. After watching the video the next morning and seeing the erratic movement, I\u2019m kicking myself for ending the recording early.\n\nOne final thing of note is that I have been working on spiritual development much more in the past few weeks. I have been meditating (Joe Dispenza) for 20-30 minutes daily. I have also been following 3I/ATLAS with open minded curiosity.

During the session, I captured not one, but two UFOs(Viewed through my telescope with my own eyes as it happened). Due to how my telescope focuses, anything like a plane, bird, or insect would appear as an unrecognizable blur, and aircraft would display visible lights. This eliminates those explanations for what I recorded. \n\nRevisiting older, unplanned footage from earlier this year, I enhanced it and found the same type of object \u2014 a dark, darting UAP. On closer inspection, it appears to break through clouds and follow a vertical zig-zag path, skipping like a flat stone over water. In one case, it moved from near the horizon to directly overhead within a few frames at 30fps, emerging from the clouds.\n\nFor skeptics, note that the \u201cpsionics requests\u201d labels may be coincidental, as UAP appearance in those moments is not proven to be related. Keep in mind: the footage is **real**, regardless of what you choose not to believe. I\u2019m not calling these alien crafts, but they are unidentified flying objects in the basic sense. My telescope\u2019s narrow FOV and small focus area mean close objects like bugs blow up into massive blurs or disappear, which I\u2019ve tested repeatedly, ruling that out. Planes don\u2019t fit due to no blinking lights. I suspect they\u2019re in the upper atmosphere, not near the moon, as nearby objects would be giant blurry blobs in this setup, not the small, contained shapes I captured. Motion blur and resolution limits explain their lack of clarity, not proximity. \n\n  \nWith my expertise in video analysis, I took a fine comb through the footage, particularly the second video, where size, speed, and frame tracking show it couldn\u2019t be an insect or bird\u2014its behavior suggests it would have had to teleport to be noticeable, pointing to a UAP breaching the clouds. \n\nI hope people find this data interesting as there has been some other(though rare) sightings of things darting across the moon this week :) \n\nExtra Clarification: The moon segment was witnessed in person with my own eyes and is the most recent one.

Some time ago I stumbled upon [Custodian File](https://www.youtube.com/@custodianfile) and UAP Dragons. I was skeptical to say the least. I watched a fair amount of the videos on the channel and the pattern in how they appear and their consistent trajectory began to compel me. Enough so that I told myself I would try it the next time a helicopter flew by my house. \n\nI live in a rural area close to a great lake and near plenty of open fields. I'm also surrounded by state owned land. I'm also close enough to a military base that they consistently use the state land for training. The lake provides opportunities for coast guard helicopters to fly over as well. The other day one flew over and so I walked outside to test. Well I never expected to reproduce what is shown on the Custodian File channel. People can say what they want about what they think these things are, but they're not bugs or birds. \n\nI uploaded to YT and here's a link for the original file with metadata stripped. The provided file is much clearer and provides an interesting perspective when it's in contrast with the vegetation. Comparing it at full speed and then zoomed in frame by frame is interesting.\n\n- [Screen Grabs](https://imgur.com/a/klhSltC)\n\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc1T1Z7119Q) - Compression here doesn't help\n\n- [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_4Vd7S4dLzHnzLZTfaxzCkx7MhFPxsQK?usp=sharing)\n\nThere was also a recent post, \"UFO over The Hague, Netherlands\", with the top comment saying it was a balloon. Idk what that was but there's three different moments in that video that could potentially be the same thing. This is the video that gave me the idea for a plan.\n\nI'm also betting these are the same things Richard Banduric is talking about being all over the place and that you can find them in a not fully functional state. \n\nPlan time. \n\n- Part 1 - The Hague video and some other thoughts that have been floating around the UFO circles had me thinking. If they'll show up because of a balloon, they'll show up because of a kite. I'll continue to attempt to record them when there's local air traffic and with a giant kite. I'll post them to the drive and the YT channel as they come up. Maybe I'll get lucky enough to video a portion of the trajectory that allows me to approximate its landing. Then go hiking to look for a needle in a forest. \n\n- Part 2 - I get enough air traffic that a high end camera on top of my 40 foot radio antenna could provide great video evidence. \n\nThe parts I'd love some help with are:\n- Any ideas on how to locate something that supposedly cloaks itself to blend in with the environment.\n- What camera setup would be good enough to capture something that is potentially 10 inches to 2 feet in size at a distance of 1 to 1.5km moving extremely fast. \n\nBest case scenario we add evidence to whatever this is, worst case I film a bunch of flying nothing burgers.", "report_date": "2025-08-29T01:55:16+00:00", "sighting_id": 382, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": "Parsing: ai_parser, TZ: explicit_utc, Date conf: 0.95, Loc conf: 0.75; Video links: ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc1T1Z7119Q)']", "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.95, "parsing_quality": "ai_parser", "duration_seconds": null, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "203", "weather_conditions": "Overcast, Temp: 12.7\u00b0C, Wind: 6.9m/s (current conditions)"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [121.5654, 25.033]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1nhkmzh/uap_taipei/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 25.033, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": 121.5654, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/zg2gxaqipbpf1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-09-15T12:15:00+00:00", "description": "UAP Taipei\nTime : 8:15pm 15 Sept. \nLocation : Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nI just saw a triangular shaped UAP with three feint lights at the bottom.

Das ver\u00f6ffentlichte Material ist daher eine direkte Aufnahme des Originals.\n\n\n\nDieses Video zeigt eine Beobachtung, die mindestens nicht allt\u00e4glich ist.\n\nIn Berlin filmte ich ein kugelf\u00f6rmiges Objekt in mittlerer H\u00f6he, dessen Flugverhalten g\u00e4ngige Erkl\u00e4rungen in Frage stellt.\n\n\n\nAuff\u00e4llig ist, dass Form, Struktur und Man\u00f6ver des Objekts eine deutliche strukturelle \u00c4hnlichkeit mit den sogenannten \"Orbs\" oder sph\u00e4rischen UAPs (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) aufweisen, die weltweit dokumentiert werden.\n\n\n\nSeht euch das Material an und helft mir bei der Analyse.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Die Fakten zum Objekt (Meine direkte Beobachtung):\n\nIch habe das, was ich mit Sicherheit sagen kann, akribisch festgehalten:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Die Erscheinung: Das Objekt ist prim\u00e4r kugelf\u00f6rmig, aber nicht perfekt glatt. Seine Oberfl\u00e4che wirkte metallisch und reflektierte das Licht in zwei deutlichen Farben: Metallisch Rot auf der Oberseite und Metallisch Silber auf der Unterseite.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Akustische Beobachtung: Ich konnte keinerlei Ger\u00e4usche vom Objekt wahrnehmen.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Kein eigenes Licht: Das Objekt strahlte kein eigenes sichtbares Licht aus.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Kein Konventioneller Antrieb: Ich konnte keinerlei Tragfl\u00e4chen oder Rotoren erkennen.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Flugh\u00f6he: Das Objekt flog w\u00e4hrend des gesamten Beobachtungszeitraums auf gleichbleibender H\u00f6he.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Unmarkiert: Obwohl die Oberfl\u00e4che nicht perfekt glatt war und leichte Unregelm\u00e4\u00dfigkeiten zeigte, hatte das Objekt keine durchgehenden L\u00f6cher oder \u00d6ffnungen und keinerlei sichtbare Beschriftungen.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Daten-Anomalie: Die Originaldatei wei\u00dft geringf\u00fcgige Glitches auf (leichte Bild-/Tonaussetzer). Ob dies ein externer elektromagnetischer Effekt oder ein interner, tempor\u00e4rer Fehler des Aufnahmeger\u00e4ts war, ist unklar.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Das Unglaubliche Flugverhalten (Meine Sch\u00e4tzungen):\n\n\n\nHier wird es wirklich mysteri\u00f6s. Achtung: Die folgenden Daten sind Sch\u00e4tzungen, da ich aufgeregt war und die Situation in Echtzeit schwer einzusch\u00e4tzen war:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Gr\u00f6\u00dfe: Das Objekt hatte ungef\u00e4hr die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe eines Autos.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* H\u00f6he und Tempo: Ich sch\u00e4tze sehr waage, dass es in einer H\u00f6he von 200 bis 400 Metern flog und dabei Geschwindigkeiten zwischen 0 und 200 km/h aufweiste.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Kontrollierte Man\u00f6ver: Das Beeindruckendste ist die Flugdynamik: Das Objekt vollf\u00fchrte Richtungswechsel und beschleunigte und entschleunigte seine Geschwindigkeit. Ein kontrolliertes Verhalten, das man von Ballons oder gew\u00f6hnlichen Flugk\u00f6rpern nicht kennt.\n\n\n\n\u2753 Was ist das? Ich brauche eure Hilfe!\n\n\n\nIch habe Flugzeuge, Hubschrauber und Satelliten ausgeschlossen.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* K\u00f6nnte es eine Drohne sein? Wenn ja, um welches Modell handelt es sich, das so aussieht, so schnell ist und dabei absolut leise erscheint?\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Ist es ein hochgeheimes Testger\u00e4t?\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\* Handelt es sich um ein unidentifiziertes Luftph\u00e4nomen (UAP), das ich nicht erkl\u00e4ren kann?\n\n\n\nSchreibt eure Theorien in die Kommentare!

It was a beautiful and sunny day with blue skies and a few wispy cloud formations.  \n\nWe were laying in our backs when I noticed a VERY distant and faint (but still bright) white/colored light on the left side of a changing wispy cloud formation.  The object fluctuated in brightness and also would disappear and reappear in varying degrees of brightness while moving around slowly in a small area in the sky far far above us.  It was so faint she couldn\u2019t pick it out while I tried to guide her to where I was seeing it.  After a minute or so the object faded and disappeared.  \n\nThe object then reappeared on the other side of the cloud formation maybe two minutes later but this time was a bit larger and brighter (not as faint as it previously was\u2026seemed \u201ccloser\u201d) and now my girlfriend was also able to see it.  The second time I managed to catch it in video for a little bit.  \n\nI was perplexed by it.  I recognize most things in the sky both during the day and at night.  I immediately recognized it wasn\u2019t a satellite - not only because it was daytime but more importantly because it was not moving on a trajectory or in a line.  It wasn\u2019t a bird.  There were plenty of birds decently high up floating on some thermals (I filmed them too for reference), it definitely wasn\u2019t a plane (again the movement and the colors and appearing and disappearing aspects. It wasn\u2019t a balloon or Mylar balloon floating in the wind either.  Again, wasn\u2019t floating in a line (and moved left and right, up and down) and if it was a balloon it would have been reflecting the light of the sun evenly as it floated.  And it wasn\u2019t a drone from what I could tell either.  There were no beacons for one, it seemed to change color, brightness and shape a bit to our eyes and didn\u2019t have that typical drone \u201cacceleration movement\u201d that is a bit choppy and delayed.

There are 3 of us who saw it with our own eyes. I didn't post it the day I filmed it because I was afraid and I also wanted to make a 0.25x version of the video so we can analyse better. I filmed this video with a simple phone, for lack of better equipment. I apologize for not being able to take a better quality video.\n\nI saw it with my own eyes but I hurried to photograph and film it, while I was filming, I was looking through the screen of my phone. Already with the zoom of my phone, the movements were very sensitive, I did not even want to try to film AND watch with my own eyes at the same time, the video being the only proof I would have of what I saw.\n\nI looked at the wiki and it doesn't seem to match to something identified or made by man. It looks more like a \"tic-tac\" UFO without visible means of propulsion. I have never seen something like this and moving like that. The movements didn't look natural, it seems to be fast. A drone can probably do it, but visually it doesn't look like that. I think it doesn't look like a plane, a helicopter, nor a drone, nor a airship, nor a weather balloon or whatever.\n\nWhat I saw seems to be a solid, without visible windows, no visible engines, no fins, no propellers, without emission of combustion smoke or condensation trail and completely smooth. On the photos, I have the impression that the sunlight is reflecting on this object.\n\nI have already seen some drones near where I live but they don't look the same at all, they just seem to move pretty much the same, but I doubt that this is a drone. The ones I saw are black, not the same shape and you can clearly see that they have propellers.\n\nThe altitude seemed much higher to me than that of a airliner, that's why i zoomed in and out. (Maybe I shouldn't have, but you need to make decisions fast when this kind of things happen lol)\n\nIt didn't make any noise, but that doesn't prove anything, because most planes don't make any noise either.\n\nIn addition, there is an airport near (14 miles or 23 km) and we see planes every day, but the UFO goes in a south to north direction and that is not at all the direction of the planes.\n\nThere were almost no clouds that day and at that time, and no wind either (< 5 km/h).\n\nWith the zoom, the camera movement is noticeable, but after watching several times (and in 0.25x also) I have the impression that it changes direction and its movements are clearly not possible. It's difficult to stabilize the camera at 10x zoom, but there are moments where the camera is stable and yet the UFO seems to change direction.\n\nAfter this event, I also took some photos of planes, and they were all heading West, not South to North. (The planes I see every day are either heading east or west, I've never seen one coming from the South and heading North here)\n\nI would like to point out that a little further south (maybe he comes from the South), there is the Mediterranean Sea. I specify this because the declassified videos often shows the UFOs above the sea, and some people say that some UFOs can go underwater.\n\nThen I edited the video to make it slow motion and uploaded the footage to YouTube at 0.25x (I forgot, but you can also put the video in normal speed)\n\nHere is the link : [https://youtu.be/VwU2c4qufMI](https://youtu.be/VwU2c4qufMI)\n\nI cannot estimate the size of this object, nor its altitude, but I recommend that you inform yourself about the Nimitz incident in 2004. It is the observation made by professionals that is the most faithful to what I saw, photographed and filmed.\n\n\"The story of the Tic Tac begins around November 10, 2004, when radar operator Kevin Day first reported seeing odd and slow-moving objects flying in groups of five to ten off of San Clemente Island, west of the San Diego coast. At an elevation of 28,000 feet, moving at a speed of approximately 120 knots (about 138 miles per hour), the clusters were too high to be birds, too slow to be conventional aircraft, and were not traveling on any established flight path, at least according to Day.\"\n\nIn 2023, David Fravor, the pilot who reported the USS Nimitz sighting from the FLIR video, gave testimony under oath regarding the incident in a United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing.\n\nThey had identified a flying object measuring 40 feet long (12 meters), oblong in shape (tic tac), hovering somewhere between 15,000 (4572 meters) and 24,000 feet (7315 meters) in midair. It was recorded by Lt. Commander Chad Underwood of the USS Nimitz off the coast of southern California. Dave Fravor was the boss of Chad Underwood. There's also Dave Fravor's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience, as well as on Lex Fridman's YouTube channel. He talks about the \"Tic Tac\" UFO and analyzes the footage.

This is a live photo my uncle took on his iPhone 16 Pro Max. You can see (at least) two UFOs move from the left of the photo to the right, one under the balloon and one above. The one that appears to pass below the balloon looks like it accelerates rapidly around the 1 second mark, as there is one frame where it looks like it disappears completely.\n\nI have attached the .mp4 file I exported from the live photo. I am not sure the best way to approach this photo/video analysis wise, so if any of you could please recommend a way to better understand what's flying around in the photo, or to pursue such a method yourself with whatever software, I would be very grateful. I will comment with an exported .jpeg photo as well as zoomed-in one. Also, if there is any more information that I could provide that would be of use, do let me know. Thank you!\n\n(I will say that this was quite shocking to me. My very not tech-savvy uncle first sent me a screenshot of the zoomed in image in his photo library, and I thought it was probably something ordinary or a distortion. I then asked him for the original, and when I saw that there were multiple, and that they appeared to move so fast, I really didn't know what to think.

He was in the pool and saw what he thought was a drone. (He was annoyed because last year our utilities company sent out a drone and didn\u2019t inform the neighborhood) But as he watched the drone move a short distance behind the utility pole and was waiting for it to come out the other side, it never came past and he suddenly saw it just appear over a house down the block. He said that happened about 3 more times where it was just still and then disappeared and reappeared in a completely different area. This all took place within about 2 minutes of time. He got out of the pool to grab his phone, but then he didn\u2019t see it anymore. My husband wants to believe in ufos, but he\u2019s always been very skeptical. He has started believing it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re real since the Nimitz footage came out because he served on the Nimitz from 1985-89 and doesn\u2019t think the pilots were making any of it up.

The first night was incredible, they appeared to have green and red lights like a plane, but the distance between the lights was far too great for any aircraft. I tried viewing them through binoculars, but couldn\u2019t get a clear look. Even with a small IR camera, (which I filmed these with), they still seemed strange. They appeared both extremely close and bright, yet somehow distant at the same time.\n\nOn the second night, while skywatching, I scanned the area for about ten minutes and saw nothing. Then I focused my thoughts and asked telepathically, \u201cAre you out there?\u201d Almost immediately after the thought left my mind, two red lights appeared and began to intensify, it felt as if it was coming straight toward me. The objects were zigzagging or moving in circles, brightening and dimming. Suddenly a flashing light appeared out of nowhere (visible in my video) and almost seemed to guide them away after hovering in one spot for a bit. They gradually faded, the flashing light departed, and for the next ten minutes planes began flying over frequently as if something had changed. Just as I thought it was over, another bright light appeared very low, tucked itself behind the trees, and vanished.\nHere are some other videos I\u2019ve taken of strange Pulsating Zigzagging orbs,\n[Pulsating orb](https://www.reddit.com/r/SentientOrbs/s/26kddRkj2K) \n[Easier to see Orb](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/s/SVuCnYgVKz)\n[Pulsating Orb](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/s/dCYvTAyZVR) \n[Pulsating Orb, I\u2019m actually shocked how many I\u2019ve filmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/SentientOrbs/s/kVkOCMaglQ) \nthey appear where my intention is placed, or they will do a very slow Brighting and dimming, similar to what I filmed the past two nights. I\u2019ve also witnessed massive, fast moving craft of various shapes, triangular, rectangular, boomerang, even long cigar like forms. They move low and fast, like glowing shadows with faint lights embedded in their bodies. Whenever I encounter these shadowy craft, there\u2019s a distinct physical sensation, a surge similar to fight or flight mixed with an almost electric feeling that I can practically hear.\n\nOne time, I saw an orange orb streak across the sky from horizon to horizon over the flat cornfields, maybe 100 to 300 feet above the ground. It moved with incredible speed, no tail, and emitted a sharp, high pitched buzzing sound. As it passed directly over me, I sat up on my trampoline to get a clear look and, for a split second, could almost make out a plus shaped pattern glowing in orange & white light at its core.\n\nRight after it vanished past the horizon, a voice in my mind told me to \u201clook to the right\u201d and there, low to the ground, was a boomerang shaped shadow craft, strikingly similar to what Kenneth Arnold once described.\n\nI\u2019ll be out again tonight.\n\nEncounters like this aren\u2019t new to me. I\u2019ve been deeply researching this topic for years, which inspired me to create presentations laying out the evidence that many of these sightings are actually plasmatic entities. \n[Conscious Plasmas & UFO Coverups](https://youtu.be/5gytB1KmoJo?si=0eRLTWVRdDFyhBd2)\n[Pentagon UAP Footage Plasmoid Anomalies](https://youtu.be/t-d6wTLlhRY?si=7DJMsyPfkZDftR7m )\n[STS 75 Tether Experiment Analysis & plasma Talk](https://youtu.be/YskSbq4kWu4?si=OkUQlrmQ4CN4uP4h ) \n\nI believe they\u2019re very similar to the anomalies seen in the STS-75 tether experiment and other space missions. There\u2019s even a scientific report that mapped the trajectories of these plasmas, [showing how they changed direction or merged](https://youtu.be/RGiMzJXAHgo?si=0ez-6qeO7LHq0slk) , but because it wasn\u2019t \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d many dismissed it outright, ignoring the fact that the strange behavior is clearly visible, they\u2019ll even ignore the very detailed [UK Defense UAP Report \u201cProject Condign\u201d](https://archive.org/details/condign-vol-2-1-258) Similarly, the research done by the Tedesco Brothers, who implemented the highest and most stringent standards of the Scientific Method, have filmed and documented very similar things. \n\nHere is a report I wrote and posted connecting the dots between the Project Condign Report, Immaculate Constellation and multiple other sources [Reddit Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/s/OTXe3PlWZ5) \nHere\u2019s another report laying out a bunch of evidence about Plasmas, and the connection to ESP (remote Viewing, telepathy ETC) [Reddit Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/s/hqPThpYp09)  \n\nRemember what Ben Rich, former Director of Lockheed Martin said \u201c*Its all about ESP*\u201d.  I don\u2019t think these are craft with little aliens flying in them, I believe the whole thing is some sort of creature or being, Similar to what Trevor James Constable Postulates, and even Kenneth Arnold who in Ray Palmer's Flying Saucers magazine, Mr. Arnold said:\n*\"After some 14 years of extensive research, it is my conclusion that the so-called unidentified flying objects that have been seen in our atmosphere are not spaceships from another planet at all, but are groups and masses of living organisms that are as much a part of our atmosphere and space as the life we find in the oceans. The only major difference in the space and atmospheric organisms is that they have the natural ability to change their densities at will\u201d*\nI need to add I believe there are nuts and bolts craft as well, that use the same space/ energy as these plasma entities, which Likely is produced through radiant energy found in abundance inside space time itself. \n \nI guess I\u2019m using these amazing videos to pierce the cognitive dissonance so often times encounter in the UFO community. my hopes is that a few people will take the time, after watching these videos, and read what I\u2019ve presented and then implement independent thought to research it then selves. \n\nI\u2019m curious to see what kind of reactions these new videos will bring. \n\n***The Truth Is Out There***", "report_date": "2025-09-27T19:14:31+00:00", "sighting_id": 475, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": "Parsing: ai_parser, TZ: explicit_utc, Date conf: 0.95, Loc conf: 0.80; Video links: ['https://youtu.be/5gytB1KmoJo?si=0eRLTWVRdDFyhBd2)', 'https://youtu.be/t-d6wTLlhRY?si=7DJMsyPfkZDftR7m', 'https://youtu.be/YskSbq4kWu4?si=OkUQlrmQ4CN4uP4h', 'https://youtu.be/RGiMzJXAHgo?si=0ez-6qeO7LHq0slk)']", "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.95, "parsing_quality": "ai_parser", "duration_seconds": 180, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "38912", "weather_conditions": "Clear sky, Temp: 18.9\u00b0C, Wind: 9.7m/s (current conditions)"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.22, 51.55]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1o1o46o/anyone_know_what_this_was/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 51.55, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -0.22, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/z824u99siytf1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-10-08T19:03:00+00:00", "description": "anyone know what this was?\nTime: 20:03\nLocation: London, England, Northwest\nDate: 8/10/2025\n\ncame from being out with some friends and was waiting for another to pick me up, saw this in the air and thought it looked odd, anyone know what it is?", "report_date": "2025-10-08T21:36:28+00:00", "sighting_id": 520, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": "Parsing: ai_parser, TZ: explicit_utc, Date conf: 0.90, Loc conf: 0.80", "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "date_confidence": 0.9, "parsing_quality": "ai_parser", "duration_seconds": 20, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "8869", "weather_conditions": "Partly cloudy, Temp: 11.6\u00b0C, Wind: 2.1m/s (current conditions)"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-123.0266, 49.0952]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1o5xhof/uap_spotted_in_british_columbia_canada/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 49.0952, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -123.0266, "media_url": "https://v.redd.it/6n4j4qocayuf1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "event_date": "2025-10-12T02:55:00+00:00", "description": "UAP spotted in British Columbia Canada?\nTime: Spotted at 7:55PM October 11th\n\nLocation: Delta, BC, Canada \n\nFor context, I was driving to a family dinner with my cousins when I spotted the strange lights.

I was walking my dog and I had spotted what looked like 2 very black gumdrop looking objects in the sky, perhaps about 400+ meters apart. My dog needed to do her business so it took me a while to get to a point where I could stop and point my potato at the sky. I was only able to shoot one of them from that vantage point. I hadn't seen lights on either of the objects but I only noticed them once I started shooting with my phone. I wear glasses and had to take them off in order to be able to see my phones screen. As a result I lost physical sight of the object and at that time was concentrating on trying to get my 2x shitty optical zoom with enhanced digital zoom to focus in. The object blinks in and out but that is because the phone is struggling to focus. At about 13seconds on the raw footage, you can see a moment where the potato upgrades to a beet and we can see what look like 2 red lights and some sort of plume coming from the bottom side of the object. The video ends with me stopping it unceremoniously do to doody duty. My dogs business was done. The odd thing was that the moment I stopped recording and put my glasses back on, both objects were gone. I know this is a stretch but it was almost like the object detected my surveillance and blinked out. This is pretty close to a police academy and I do know they are are actively incorporating drones in their surveillance training. Also I have heard the Chinese military were in town due to national day so there is also that. I can say that the location I was in is no where relevant to any military activity whatsoever so if these where aircraft or some sort of new surveillance tech, it would be a strange location to test them. Never quite seen a drone in this configuration in HK, it's mostly drone hobbyists or companies testing out drones for delivery or mapping. If there is any drones that hover with a jet plume, I would be really interested in finding more about them.

I've seen the \"regular\" lights from the viewing area and these were different. They usually stay pretty close to the ground. These were much higher and just looked different. It came up and then traveled right to left in about a 45 degree arc, paused, then left to right in about a 90 degree arc. It repeated a couple of times before I lost it behind a silo. It looked like it bounced a little occasionally. I did find it again and have another video a little shorter but not as good because it seemed to be getting dimmer.

It was right above my neighbors house but it also looked really far away.  The weirdest part took me a while to notice. When it was happening I saw it as suspended and fixated in one spot. But when you watch closely in the beginning of the video, you can see it\u2019s following my movement to the side. It stayed so perfectly parallel to me that I didn\u2019t notice it in real time. then it got smaller and changed to white lights and becomes this silent plane flying at a 45 degree angle.

But I finally managed to capture the sighting on camera. two times. \n\nI was driving down a back country straigh road after i finished work. Nothing new just the same listening to music driving home. \nI looked up and seen a plane flying through the sky, cool kept driving. Looked up again to see a bright white light just smack bang in the centre of the road but at the same height as the plane in the sky. It was not moving sideways or up or down. It was just chilling up there near the plane. \n\nThere were no flashes from other lights and there was no noise whatso ever. So I pull over because I want to film this. Once pulled over I get out and thats when it starts moving off to the left. And then I filmed the thing. The whole time no noise except cars passing. Its got me confused.
