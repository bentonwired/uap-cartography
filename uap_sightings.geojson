They said it looked like a 'ball of metal' that you could see through, about the size of a small car, no sound or visible camera, the 'blackest black they've ever seen', and it landed in my mom's driveway.\n**Time: September of 2021, Around 4:00pm**\n\n**Location: 15 miles west of Fort Wayne, Indiana**\n\nSome of the facts my mom, brother, and his fianc\u00e9 said they saw:\n\nThey were all talking in my mom's backyard, with my mom facing the house, and my brother and his fianc\u00e9 with their backs to the house. The driveway runs along the left side of the house, when viewed from the backyard.\n\nMy mom said as my brother was talking, something caught her eye above the driveway. When she looked to see what it was, she said she interrupted my brother with...WHAT THE F\\*\\*K?! (which my mom rarely says)\n\nMy mom said without thinking, she started to run up to it, and it was now hovering inches above the driveway. She said as she approached it, it seemed like it 'noticed' her, as it seemed to 'turn towards her', and she had a 'feeling' that it saw her. Like that feeling when you know someone is watching you.\n\nMy brother and his fianc\u00e9 then started to approach as well, and as they got fairly close, it slowly rose up, and went slowly into the sky. My mom claims that it seemed to change shape as it went into the sky and get further away, claiming it started to look like a 'jetpack man', or 'someone with a cape on'. My guess it was just the weird shape/design playing tricks on the eyes as it got further away or turned in the sky.\n\nSome of the details I have got from them:\n\n* The color was the 'blackest black' they have ever seen, but not glossy black.\n* It was round in shape, but like a mesh/see-thru design, with nothing in the middle.\n* It was the size of a compact car, maybe slightly smaller.\n* My mom said the design looked like 'randomly placed lightning-bolt shaped metal', haphazardly 'thrown together'.\n* There was no sound when near it, no sound when lifting up and flying away.\n* They saw no visible motor, camera, propulsion system, etc.\n\nI tried to get them all to individually draw what they saw, while the memory was fresh, but none of them did. I've since asked my brother why he hasn't tried to figure out what he saw, and his response was that he tried to research it, but couldn't find anything close, so he 'gave up looking'.\n\nMy mom still talks about this, and it totally baffles her mind, and mine as well. I had a friend that worked as the head of the local community airport, who was also in the Air Force, and asked him if he had any idea what it was, or if any kind of R&D or weird aircraft was reported flying that day, or in the area. He confirmed there wasn't and told me that his only and best guess, was that it was some sort of realtor drone. While I appreciated him taking it serious, none of them thought that could be it. Not with it being round, without any kind of moving parts.\n\nTBH, if just my mom or just my brother said they saw this, I would think they were bat-shit crazy. The fact that they all saw it together, makes me believe without a doubt that they saw something.\n\nI have been asked when telling friends about it, 'why didn't they snap a photo?' I've explained in other threads where people ask similar questions, it's important to understand the human brain a little. If something lands in front of you that you have never seen, and have a hard time understanding, it's mesmerizing. The brain goes into full WTF-IS-THIS mode, and by the time you think to snap a picture or video, its already out of sight or too far to get a good shot. \n\nI think this also explains why a lot of UAP/UFO pictures and videos are crap. People are more focused on figuring out what they are seeing, rather than creating a record of it.\n\nLast, I've tried to take all of the details they told me, and run it through an AI photo generator, but every time my mom says it doesnt look the same. I'm just hoping that someone on here might have an idea of what they saw, or maybe saw something similar.", "report_date": "2025-03-22T18:57:08", "sighting_id": 11, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": null, "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "duration_seconds": null, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "17548", "weather_conditions": null}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-4.2501687, 55.861155]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1kaaxso/can_anyone_explain_this/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 55.861155, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -4.2501687, "event_date": "2025-04-28T07:00:00", "description": "Can anyone explain this\nI posted a different video earlier but it was removed due to post requirements not being met so I have a new video to share of same object but it has a better representation of the movement.

I don\u2019t have the exact details of time or month but I remember the event vividly as if I was there yesterday. \n\nIt was the summer of 2009, the weather was warm and tropical like there was a recent hurricane down south and we had started to get the after effects from the weather system. It was somewhat late at night, right around 10:30pm. Me and my brother were staying at my grandparents house that night for a sleepover, we did this frequently. Me, my brother and my grandpa were all watching a movie in the living room, having ice cream sundaes. Suddenly my grandpa remembers that he forget to lock up the carlot, at the time he owned a local used car dealership, less than a quarter mile down the road from his house. He decides that we should go over to the carlot with him and help lock up shop. So we all got in his old school chevy truck and drove over to the carlot. He decided to park out front since  he had to go through the front door to access the back door. We all get out and he goes inside while me and my brother stand outside waiting for him. As we are waiting outside, I enjoyed looking at the stars, and it with it being such as warm night, the skies were clear so you could see plenty. I started looking south first, then a bit more southwest to west, eventually I turn my gaze north in the direction towards my small hometown city of Elmira, we were on the outskirts of the city. As I began looking down the road, my gaze began to move upwards towards the sky. As soon as I began looking up towards the sky above the city area, I see this massive looking all black triangular ship. I had never seen anything like it, it was thick like a piece of pie but you couldn\u2019t see anything but the shape, it was so black, it was darker than the night sky. It had three large blue colored \u201cthrusters\u201d on the back of the ship. The ship appeared to be moving, but so slight that it appeared motionless. It silently hovered in the sky. I immediately went into a state of disbelief and asked my brother if he was seeing what I was seeing, he said yes and we both just stared in amazement. As I began to look longer, I noticed some kind of pole descending from the middle of the bottom of the ship, at the end of this pole was an egg or tictac like shape. It was completely mesmerizing. We stood there for about 5-10 minutes just staring at this massive looking triangular ship. The ship must have been 10 football fields in length and 2 football fields thick, it truly was massive in scale but high enough where perception could be distorted. When my grandpa finally came out the front door again, I immediately point him in the direction of ship, he stated to me that he didn\u2019t see anything, but I still see it there. We eventually get back in the truck and start heading back to his house, as we drive away I continued to stare at this ship until it\u2019s out of visual distance. I never brought the story up again until I was about 17-18 and my brother claimed he still remembers it too. I remember it much more vividly than him but it baffles me still to this day. \n\nI drew a sketch of what it looked like in the sky", "report_date": "2025-03-24T05:37:59", "sighting_id": 26, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": null, "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "duration_seconds": null, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "10", "weather_conditions": null}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-99.1619751, 19.3498606]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1jm9b5z/28032025_539_m\u00e9xico_city_coyoac\u00e1n/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 19.3498606, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -99.1619751, "event_date": "2025-03-28T17:39:00", "description": "28/03/2025, 5:39, M\u00e9xico City, Coyoac\u00e1n\nTime: 5:39, 28/03/2025 \nLocation: M\u00e9xico City, Coyoac\u00e1n \n\nFINALLY, AFTER MONTHS OF SEARCHING FOR THE PERFECT SHOT, MONTHS OF PEOPLE CALLING ME CRAZY, MONTHS OF SEEING THE SAME OBJECT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO RECORD A GOOD VIDEO, HERE IT IS\u2014THE OBJECT, THE BEST TWO VIDEOS TO DATE.

Open to ideas.\nTime: 8:05pm\n\nLocation: Henderson Nevada \n\nI don\u2019t like to jump to conclusions so I will keep it short and not add my speculation opting instead for just the facts of what I witnessed. I was on an evening walk with my mother when we both stopped talking and looked at a strange color changing orb in the sky. We both started to record and I managed to get the ball of light moving across the sky but just as I stopped recording and it started to vanish right in font of our eyes. \n\nAt the time I was not aware that my mom was still recording and she captured the object phasing out of visibility. In person in looked as if it cloaked but I don\u2019t want to speculate so it vanished is the simplest way I could put it. There was no sound and visible tail like a comet or shooting star. It was shifting colors and there was no haze or light scatter. It was moving steady but not super fast. \n\nThe videos do this no justice at all. It was so bright and vivid and moved as if there was no friction. I then recorded the airplanes flying around just to show how different the light from aircraft look as opposed to this object on camera let alone in person. I can post those for comparison if anyone wants to compare just let me know. All in all I\u2019m not sure what it is but neither of us can figure it out. You can see the aircraft and they are daily identifiable in the area we walk in so this stood out and was nothing like the rest of what we saw. If anyone has ideas or speculation don\u2019t hesitate chime in. \n\nBoth cameras capture a slightly different aspect as they zoom to different.

Description of sighting: I filmed anomalous orbs in four clips in one night with my Sony RX10 Mk. IV and a Wyze Cam V4\nLocation: Veneta, Oregon. Date: 3-12-2025. Time: 8:52pm PST. Duration: 30 minutes. Number of witnesses: two people, two cameras. Description of sighting: I filmed anomalous orbs in four clips in one night with my Sony RX10 Mk. IV and a Wyze Cam V4\n\nThis is a compilation of my best footage since I gained renewed interest in skywatching last fall. The footage features anomalous objects filmed at dusk, night and dawn around the Oregon Country Fairgrounds and surrounding areas. Anything I choose to upload has been cross-checked via three or more of the listed databases in the acknowledgments, to rule out the vast majority of human activity. All footage is from one of three locations- a lot just south of hwy 126, west of Countryside Pizza,  my street, just north of the Oregon Country Fair, and once from a car driving south on territorial, towards Countryside Pizza.\n\nThese objects exhibit change in heading and velocity, all the way from outclassing other aircraft to stopping midair.
