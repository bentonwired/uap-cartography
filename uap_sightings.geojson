Duration: 30 minutes. Number of witnesses: two people, two cameras. Description of sighting: I filmed anomalous orbs in four clips in one night with my Sony RX10 Mk. IV and a Wyze Cam V4\n\nThis is a compilation of my best footage since I gained renewed interest in skywatching last fall. The footage features anomalous objects filmed at dusk, night and dawn around the Oregon Country Fairgrounds and surrounding areas. Anything I choose to upload has been cross-checked via three or more of the listed databases in the acknowledgments, to rule out the vast majority of human activity. All footage is from one of three locations- a lot just south of hwy 126, west of Countryside Pizza,  my street, just north of the Oregon Country Fair, and once from a car driving south on territorial, towards Countryside Pizza.\n\nThese objects exhibit change in heading and velocity, all the way from outclassing other aircraft to stopping midair. They do not behave like any publicly-known satellite or aircraft. They cross paths with one or more other (usually smaller) objects flying intersecting, tightly overlapping routes. Modern propulsion systems cannot explain their behavior.\n\nThey carry no legally required lighting and run no types of transponder, exemptions for which are exceedingly rare. Using just my footage, an extremely frequent repeat route can be established- on most nights, into morning, at least one object will slowly pass west-to-east over the fairgrounds, usually several. \n\nThese objects vary greatly in color, size, behavior, and grouping, often traveling in perfectly interlocked pairs and triangle formations, moving in unison. \n\nThis compilation icludes footage recorded on a Sony RX10 Mk.IV  camera (4K video), a Fimi Mini 3 Drone (4k Video), A Sony IMX678 Starvis2 box camera with a 5-50 mm cs mount varifocal lens (4k video), A full-color & infrared night vision camera with a Sony \"starlight\" sensor and 15x zoom (4k Video), a Google Pixel 7 (4k video), a Wyze Cam V4 (2.5k video), and a Rettru Q8S Starlight color night vision security camera (1080p video). \nEnjoy, much more to come", "report_date": "2025-04-14T01:47:51+00:00", "sighting_id": 48, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": null, "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "duration_seconds": null, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "727", "weather_conditions": null}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-121.890591, 37.3361663]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1k11lu2/orbdrone_over_san_jose_ca_4162025/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 37.3361663, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -121.890591, "event_date": "2025-04-16T23:45:00+00:00", "description": "Orb/drone over San Jose, Ca 4/16/2025\nSaw this over dtsj on my walk home 20 minutes ago.\n\nTime: 6:45\nLocation: San Jose, CA", "report_date": "2025-04-16T18:56:46+00:00", "sighting_id": 54, "anomaly_score": null, "research_notes": null, "vetting_status": "Unreviewed", "duration_seconds": null, "confidence_rating": null, "account_reputation": "29", "weather_conditions": null}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-80.8430827, 35.2272086]}, "properties": {"source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1jybcpf/is_this_a_common_sighting/", "vetted": false, "archive": false, "latitude": 35.2272086, "hoax_flag": false, "longitude": -80.8430827, "event_date": "2025-04-12T21:15:00+00:00", "description": "Is this a common sighting?\nTime: 5:15 pm\nLocation: Charlotte, NC\n\nIs this a common sighting?

You can still see two blinking dots\u2026 when one, out of nowhere, gets SUPER bright!  No idea why?  I even looked up a lot about 747 flood lights and landing lights\u2026 etc.  The other blinking light turned red from white.  There are more steady lights that don\u2019t blink, and other weird stuff in the sky later in the video (which I can also upload).  We even caught the ISS, or a satellite on camera later, and it looked nothing like these lights.  But this was weird.

I had a 14 hour film shoot the day before so I was surprised my body woke me up so early given how exhausted I was. Usually when I wake up around this time I will go for a run around the block, I thought that it might make me feel better and help me fall back asleep again if I went on a quick one. \n\nThings were going as they usually do until I felt this warmth in my stomach, just as I notice my stomach warming up I feel the urge to vomit and then do so. The second I\u2019m done throwing up I look up into the sky to catch my breathe and there was a red orb doing all sorts of absolutely mind bending maneuvers. It was whizzing around the sky in a sort of zig zag diagonal pattern. It was so hard to not notice that I started to wipe my eyes due to me thinking clearly they must have been watering having just thrown up, but no, dry as a bone. I don\u2019t suffer from astigmatism and have 20/20 vision, this thing was clear as day. \n\nAfter standing there dumbstruck I pull out my phone to record it. The SECOND and I mean the literal second that I switched to my camera on my phone (not opening my phone but right as I switched to the camera app) it slowed down and just disappeared. I managed to get the orb and it disappearing on camera. \n\nAs you can hear In the video I probably sound pretty nasally given the 2 events happened right after each other and I had almost no time to process what the fuck just happened.

Open to ideas.\nTime: 8:05pm\n\nLocation: Henderson Nevada \n\nI don\u2019t like to jump to conclusions so I will keep it short and not add my speculation opting instead for just the facts of what I witnessed. I was on an evening walk with my mother when we both stopped talking and looked at a strange color changing orb in the sky. We both started to record and I managed to get the ball of light moving across the sky but just as I stopped recording and it started to vanish right in font of our eyes. \n\nAt the time I was not aware that my mom was still recording and she captured the object phasing out of visibility. In person in looked as if it cloaked but I don\u2019t want to speculate so it vanished is the simplest way I could put it. There was no sound and visible tail like a comet or shooting star. It was shifting colors and there was no haze or light scatter. It was moving steady but not super fast. \n\nThe videos do this no justice at all. It was so bright and vivid and moved as if there was no friction. I then recorded the airplanes flying around just to show how different the light from aircraft look as opposed to this object on camera let alone in person. I can post those for comparison if anyone wants to compare just let me know. All in all I\u2019m not sure what it is but neither of us can figure it out. You can see the aircraft and they are daily identifiable in the area we walk in so this stood out and was nothing like the rest of what we saw. If anyone has ideas or speculation don\u2019t hesitate chime in. \n\nBoth cameras capture a slightly different aspect as they zoom to different.

On Tuesday, April 29th at 20:37, what I\u2019ve been waiting for over many years happened.\nAround 30 objects flew towards Oslo.

Unfortunately, the camera doesn\u2019t capture how clearly visible they were to the naked eye, and in the footage it looks like they\u2019re much farther away.\n\nThey were all within our atmosphere, and we saw them crystal clear.\n\nCheck the video!
